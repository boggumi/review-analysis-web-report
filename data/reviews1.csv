4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  It's a pretty good, inexpensive casual or business casual shirt.  Basic with few extras but pretty good.<br><br>It fits as expected and is comfortable but there are some minor finish issues and it lacks what other shirts in this range have.<br><br>For example, it has no side pleats in back and doesn't have a box pleat below the yoke.  It also doesn't have a hanging loop but I don't care about that.  If you do you'll be disappointed.  So the back is a plain back which is not a problem for me but for some, who wear this to work and want a more finished look it may be an issue.  If you're wearing it under a coat no problem of course but you'll have to take it off sometime :-D<br><br>The right cuff buttons are just a tad off so the cuff hem doesn't match exactly. This is only noticeable to me and only because I seem to have a habit of messing with them. So it isn't visible but can be felt.<br><br>Also, there are lots of loose threads from production that aren't removed so be ready to give the shirt a quick going over when you get it.  Most of them were simply loose pieces and pulled right out, but a couple of the buttons had to have the threads trimmed.  Not a big deal.<br><br>I'd give it 5 stars but for the few little issues I mention. Overall a solid shirt (pardon the pun) and a great standby for any traditional guy's closet.

  This is one of Van Heusen's better quality made shirts. Although not completely iron free, if you wash and dry with a small load and remove from the dryer and hang immediately you won't require much ironing, none at all for those that wear these as casual shirts. I iron everything I wear. These are very well made shirts. Not thin or see through. But not hot and heavy either. They look great with a sport coat and jeans, or as a dress shirt. For the price $22.00, you simply can't beat these shirts. The colors are vivid. It's hard finding Striped Oxford shirts without paying at least $50.00 a pop or more. These are well worth every cent. I'd order more if they had more colors. Sizes are true in American sizing. So order your regular size without worrying about China's sizing. Great shirts.

  I have ordered quite a few of these shirts the past year. So, I guess that the odds of me receiving one that was flawed was bound to happen. The issue is that I bought this shirt the end of February as a gift for my son in law. He did not wear the shirt right away because he was asked to work from home due to Covid19 the past ten weeks. Recently he wore the shirt and then washed it only to discover the unfinished seems at the cuff of each arm. It is past the time frame for me to return the shirt to the vender nor am I able to attempt the return...I would exchange this shirt if I could. Its disappointing. Darn Covid19!

  I have had a difficult time finding shirts that fit just right and are well constructed. I usually like Van Heusen and these shirts are no different. The fit is great, neck size is good and sleeve length is great. The material is a little on the heavy side, in a good way and all of the stitching feels durable. I really like the collar on these, after buttoning them down they hold their shape well and look good with a sweater or jacket. I have not worn them with a tie yet, but they do button snuggly but not too tightly.<br><br>I originally bought one shirt to test it out. I have since bought two more in other colors so I can add them to my regular rotation.<br><br>For the price I think these are fantastic.

  I’m 6’2”, 180lbs, fit. I purchased the blue 16.5, 34/35 which fits me well, which includes the sleeve length. This my review:<br>PROS:<br>- Overall looks good although not great.<br>- Fitting is correct, as long as you know your measurements, you will get the right size.<br>CONS:<br>- The fabric is very thick and stiff, making it uncomfortable to the skin.<br>- Extremely difficult to iron, wrinkles are insanely stubborn.<br>- The neck collar is very stiff, it scratches your neck.<br>RECOMMENDATION:<br>Not the best shirt out there, the fabric feels so rough, it does not feel high quality. I don’t recommend it.

  I bought two shirts as a backup for when they would be needed for work.  I wore the blue striped shirt twice.  It's only been washed once.  The second time I wore it, I felt it split 3"" on the left side by the seem.  It's a good looking and comfortable shirt.  I just won't buy them again.  I can't contact the buyer and return it because it's over a month since being bought.  So much for planning ahead and having shirts ready when needed.

  I rarely dress up but am going to a relative's wedding where I'll have to wear a coat and tie to 2 different events. I'm more a jeans and flannel shirt guy.  I do have an older, but nice, blazer and needed to build a wardrobe around it. Although I haven't worn it anywhere yet, but it fits great and looks good.  I don't think I'll be embarrassing the family or myself. I also bought a light blue Van Heusen shirt for the alternate night. Now, I just need to find a tie.

  I needed a semi-dressy oxford cloth shirt that I could wear with a tie to church on Sunday, as well as without a tie for general ""business casual"" use.  I have had good luck with this brand in the past, and with Amazon's guarantees and ability to return if unsatisfied, I decided to give it a try.<br><br>This is a VERY nice shirt.  Irons up very well, and it's well constructed to take a tie-- or NO tie.  The buttons are top quality, well sewn, and the fit was exactly as expected.  I liked this shirt so much that after a month I just ordered a second one.

  Another quality Van Heusen dress shirt for my 'collection'. The collection starts at 16"" then 16.5, then 17, then 17.5, so I skipped 18 for this 18.5. They're too small to wear and too good to get rid of. I keep thinking one of these years I'll lose some weight.
"

  These shirts are great, fit well (not too loose not too tight) and the best part is the sleeves really are 36-37!!  I always tell people I have monkey arms and it's so hard to get sleeves that are the correct size without getting Tall (not as common as it should be) or 2 XL which are then like wearing a tent.  These are perfect, just wish they were in a few more colors other than shades of blue ;-)
"

  I wore this shirt 1 time, then I washed it on a cold gentle cycle, delicate dryer both are large capacity, but I only washed 1 other shirt, and 2 pairs of pants and both cuff sleeves have completely fallen apart! The fabric literally shredded. Extremely poor construction. I should have realized it when threads wear coming off both sleeves the first time I wore it. I have added 3 pic's to show the shady workmanship.<br>I am not sure if I can get my money back, but I can prevent someone else from buying the terrible product, then I have done my job! Buyer BEWARE

  I purchased two of these shirts and they wrinkle pretty bad compared to other shirts these days.  I take them out of the dryer before it stops and hang them.  Even doing this they are hard to iron to get all of the wrinkles out and after wearing for a little while they look like you have slept in them.  Nice material, good fit, nice style and such.....just the wrinkling is my problem.  And I am not expecting them to be wearable out of the dryer.

  I bought four of these shirts in different colors.  They are fabulous.  The material seems high quality, they look great, and fit perfectly.  I'm on the small side, and trying to get dress shirts, much less sharp-looking dress shirts that fit is increasingly difficult.  Ant to get these shirts at this price is near-unimaginable.

  The sleeves are not 34"", but it is an ok shirt.  Definitely runs small.  I wouldn't recommend.
"

  I’m fairly gentle with my clothes and I’ve never had anything like this happen before. After first wash, cuffs became horribly frayed and mangled at the edges - had to end up cutting off several loose and frayed threads from both cuffs. I usually roll up my sleeves and I might make a mending project out of it, but I shouldn’t have to. For the record, care instructions say machine wash is fine.

  I ordered 34/35 sleeve length and it is the longest sleeve I’ve ever owned.  Have to roll up and cuff to wear otherwise I look like a pirate with billowing sleeves.  Actual measurement is closer to 37.  Useless as a work/office dress shirt unless you are Captain Jack Sparrow.

  Junk and paper thin shirt. I had to return two shirts as they had not been sewn at the edges of the sleeve cuff leaving a raw open fabric edge. They say easy care but they are heavily wrinkled straight out of the drier. Never buy again.

  This shirt is really nice looking, well made and wrinkle-free. Really, wrinkle-free. So why doesn't Van Heusen make more like this? I don't know. I certainly would buy a few more in solid colors. Now other Van Heusen shirts? Trashy, not wrinkle-free, not true to size and cheap looking although the same price. Go figure.

  An inexpensive shirt, and you get what you pay for.  The fit is a little blousy, and the fabric a bit thin.

  Unfortunately i didn't try the shirt one right after i purchased it.  This was a back up and its been way over a month since my purchase.

  I love the shirt. It is comfortable and looks great with navy slacks. I live in South Georgia, so it's definitely not a summer shirt. It fits as expected.

  It fit as expected, but as a tall person it is a tad shorter than I want, but not so bad that it renders the shirt unwearable.
"

  Nice ... would've given it 5 stars but the sleeve length was just a tad short (but acceptable).  If you are on-the-fence between sleeve length options, go with the longer sleeve.  Otherwise, fits well and looks good.

  I normally wear a 15 1/2 33-34 but of course they didnt have this size when I ordered.  So, I took a chance and ordered a 16 33-34 and it fit like a 15 1/2  Van Heusen is hit and miss that way sometimes.  Overall, its a decent shirt.

  I purchased 2 Van Husen striped shirts from a department store and like most consumers reported. After the first wash, the thread on the chest line began to come lose. Now, it looks like the shirted has the stressed look. Not a Good look in Executive meetings. My other shirt threads came out on the size, and the material simply tore.<br><br>Over owned 100s of Van Husen shirts, some wear out at the elbow, over had that a lot, but that's after 2 yrs and few washes. The colors do not bleed, but the material gets very weak of regular office environment wear. I think Van Husen is officially off my purchase list.
"
2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I ordered 3 of these shirts as they were on sale.  Unfortunately I made the mistake of not washing just one to see what it looked like.  They all look wrinkled no matter how you wash and dry them.  Even my wife who is not that picky says they always look wrinkled.  I'm not making a comparison with shirts taken to the cleaners but other shirts that are on the market.<br><br>My advice is to buy a shirt from LL Bean and then one of these.  I can guarantee that you will want to send this one back.  Sure the ones from bean are more expensive but they are much better quality, will last twice as long and yes are  actually wrinkle free.<br><br>If you want a shirt to leave untucked with jeans on casual day at work, yes you can get away with one of these.  I gave them 2 stars because I've seen worse...

  This is a nice shirt, pretty much just what I was looking for. My only suggestion is they be a little more precise on sleeve lengths. An inch makes a difference so I would prefer a 34"" sleeve over a 35"" sleeve and over a 34/35"" sleeve.
"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I like the shirt.  It fits perfectly, it's well tailored and made.  It does not come out of the dryer wrinkle free but I've order a garment steamer to hopefully take the wrinkles out.  Other than that, I like it very much.

  Shirt sleeves are different lengths.  I gave this to my father in law as a gift for Christmas and he just opened it.  Apparently too late to return it deadline was 01/31 and it is now 02/04 - so now he is stuck with a useless shirt...very disappointing.
"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I haven't worn these business shirts much, so here's the main point: after being tailor measured, Van Heusen fit better than a competitor. But at the time of purchase, there was a limited selection of colors and patterns by Van Heusen on Amazon (i.e. for this exact shirt style.) Which is how I found a problem with fit from a competitor shirt maker.
"

  This product looks fine and fits fine, althought the material is very thin.  However, after a few drycleanings (four or five wearings?), the cuff completely opened up at the end.  I can't see any signs of threads in there and it looks like a lot of the seams are just glued.  Oh well, the price was right.  If my $200 shirts last 4 years maybe it's right that a $25 shirt lasts 4 months.

  I like this shirt.  It has sleeves that are long enough for me.  I wanted something in red because I already had enough blue shirts.  It was exactly what I wanted.

  I got this shirt rolled up in a bag without any tags, pins etc. Somebody else returned it, obviously someone smarter than I am I am not a big guy but I have a long torso and arms and all I want is shirts that fit.

  I purchased this shirt and as I always do I wash it before use. When I went iron it I noticed a cut in the breast pocket that can’t be repaired.

  The shirt is very good as far as quality is concerned, I love the color. As far as the size is concerned, I noticed that at the reverse of the wrapping plastic bag, there are three more additional sizes: Regular, Slim and Fitted. I do not understand why these additional sizes are not included in the on line description. I could have had the option to decide what size would have been more addecuate to me, of course the regular fit is not the proper one!.
