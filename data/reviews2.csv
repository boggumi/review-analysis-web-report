  This is basically a good shirt.  Most of my shirts are Van Huesen, and I appreciate them.  However, ithis was advertised and described as a FLEX  collar, and the collar did not stretch nor flex.  It had labels on it declaring that it was a Flex collar.  I have some Van Huesen shirts with flex flex collars, that have a built-in extendable collaf. They are good.  This one did not stretch.  Otherwise a good shirt.<br>  I think the supervisor of the guy over in Bangladesh (country of origin) told him to put 275 of the ""FLEX COLLAR"" tags on by lunch time, and the worker, perhaps not being literate, worked hard to get them all affixed.

  This shirt replaced a similar Joseph Fees brand dress shirt. I did have to iron it before the first wear, but since then it's been wash, dry, &amp; wear with no worries. I wore this shirt to a job interview, and next thing I know I've moved 2000 miles and I'm making more money than I ever have. Idk if that's the shirt's fault, but it certainly didn't hurt anything!

  This is the very first product review that I have ever written and I am 77 years old.  I bought two shirts, one white and one blue and they were delivered separately.  The white one was in original packaging and was perfect (apparently by another supplier).<br>The blue shirt is the issue.  It was delivered in a loose package and it looked like someone had been sleeping in it for a week.  It was completely wrinkled and out of its original packaging.  My wife wanted me to return it or take it to the cleaners for pressing but I'm not interested in paying someone to do something that should not be needed.  My wife agreed to iron the shirt so I hope the wrinkles come out but this is ridiculous.

  The sleeves are supposed to be 36-37 inches.  Not even close.  Plus the left sleeve is about 2 inches shorter than the right sleeve.  The right sleeve is about 34 inches and the left is too short to even button.  Not a good shirt.  I returned the other shirt and will keep this because I need a dress shirt for a wedding.  But, it will be a one time wear and then junk it.

  I have always liked Van Heusen shirts,<br>As they fit well, look good too!<br>I particularly like this color, but that’s a personal<br>preference. I highly recommend the quality though.

  Fits perfect, color and texture is great. Is cut nicely, too. For $22, I'd buy this shirt regularly. Some of the other colors were priced for a lot more but I won't spend any more for a shirt I wear to work when I can drive to the mall and spend $10 on the clearance rack for dress shirts.

  This is a decent shirt. but there are a few things of note about this shirt:<br>Pros:<br>1. The neck fit is nice with a little stretch<br>2. Wrinkle free is great<br>Cons:<br>1. The shirt came with a small black spot on it that doesn't seem to come out in the wash<br>2. By ""regular fit"" they mean huge. Like really HUGE. If you are not large person you should look for a ""slim fit"" or ""skinny fit"". This is more of a ""regal fit"" in my opinion.
"

  The wrinkle free shirt definitely needs to be ironed, but I expected that. The flex neck is very comfortable. The shirt fits true to size. I could probably use more of a tapered fit (I’m not a slim fit), but I ordered the regular classic fit which has plenty of room. I ordered 4 shirts. I will order more like this if I can find other colors in my size. Please note: the first two I ordered from Macy’s were a nightmare. When they arrived (the white one had two different size sleeves, as well as different style sleeves)! I wrote a negative review on Macy’s site and returned it to Macy’s in person. The salesperson didn’t ask any questions and didn’t care when I told him the issue. I did not want them to resell the shirt! 18” neck, 32-33” sleeves. So, I ordered 2 more through Amazon. These two arrived together but one was not in it’s original packaging, and was a mess. It was scrunched up in a ball and stuffed in a plastic bag. I planned on washing/ironing them first anyway and was thankful they fit and had matching (correct) style sleeves. The issue I think was Christmas time shopping over loud  and I believe Van Heusen is going out of business.

  The neck is to large, I measured against some other shirts I have and it is over an inch bigger. It is not a stretch neck as advertised. The sleeves are short, they are 2 to 3 inches shorter than my other shirts with the same sleeve length. I would send it back but I bought it for an event and I had to wear it, now it is going to Goodwill. Don't buy this shirt
"

  Very comfortable with a nice fit. The colors are bright and bold, which are perfect for me as an elementary teacher.<br><br>The only negative I've found is that Purple Haze is awfully close to Hearth, which I had ordered previously. I believe the camera flash has left it looking a bit brighter in the demo photo above than it actually appears in real life. I was somewhat disappointed when I put it in my closet and noticed that they were very close shades of one another, with Hearth just having a tinge more red than Purple Haze.
"

  Looks great. packaged well. But as it says the neck stretches or whatever, just know I used to wear a 17 1/2 and needed bigger so I got 18 and with the stretch feature I thought I'd be ok. But it still just barely fit. I can't imagine my neck went up 2 sizes so I wouldn't really take the stretch part to the bank. If you think you need a specific size get that or maybe 1/2 bigger.

  The shirt is the same cut as the shirts I’ve bought from the brick and mirror store. However the “classic pink” is more lavender than pink. I included a picture of what it looks like compared to my husbands actual pink and purple shirts and as you can tell, it’s light purple.<br>It’s fine, I’ll keep the shirt, it’s just annoying since I was trying to replace a pink shirt.

  In a dress shirt, it's all about the collar. Fabric or prints are always overshadowed by either a sad, weak collar that won't standup or like this shirt, a stiff, vertical collar that stands up to a distinctive profile. Plenty of room in my 44 inch mid section and 50 inch chest. Ordered longer arms because I am heavier in my upper back and the length is roomy by 1 inch but I expect shrinkage by 1/2 inch. Great fit.

  Material is good thickness, not too thin like some shirts.  Breathes ok....this particular material holds hair, lint and dust pretty bad however.  This is the only color that has done that out of the 4 or 5 shirts i bought from this group.  The other colors have been ok.

  A different colored shirt that I got last year was made in Indonesia and it fit good. I wanted to get another one in gray, but they were out last year. This year's shirt supply is made poorly in Ethiopia and didn't fit well. The button holes and the buttons did not line up properly, so there was a bulge of extra fabric at the top below the collar. This is not acceptable.

  This is a nice white shirt for dress or professional wear.  And it has a chest pocket, which is a feature that is rapidly disappearing in men’s shirts!  It does not have a placket down the front of the shirt where the buttonholes are located, which to us makes this shirt look a little more casual.<br>The fit is “as expected”. My husband’s neck is between a 15 ½ and a 16, and he found the size 15 ½ a bit snug but wearable. The fit is neither slim, nor baggy; in other words, “regular” is appropriate.<br>The fabric is a bit lighter than the shirts my husband usually wears. He prefers a somewhat heavier fabric; I liked the weight of this one.<br>Then comes the acid test: the laundering! Coincidentally I washed this shirt with a white oxford-cloth dress shirt, a fabric that is my usual gold standard for wrinkle-free performance. The Van Heusen was ALMOST as wrinkle-free as the oxford cloth. It would certainly be fine under a jacket and would do for regular office wear, but I think a touch-up ironing would be in order if the wearer wanted to make an especially good impression.
"

  Fit as expected in neck and sleeves. I will add this caution to gentlemen out there who want to buy dress shirts online without trying them on, make sure to measure your neck and arms. Especially if you have a shirt size in mind, but haven’t worn a dress shirt in a few years. Or go to a department store and try some on, then come back to Amazon and save some money.<br>  Back to the shirt. Very nice, high end look. No shirt is truly wrinkle free, but this fabric once ironed should stay pretty crisp if you make sure to hang it when you’re done.<br>  The one thing I wasn’t quite sure on was the “stretch” advertised. I thought a stretch neck, or fabric with a little more give would be a great feature for a formal dress shirt, but I grabbed a handful of fabric and tugged, in both the neck and body of the shirt, there was no give at all. Just standard fabric.<br>  Doesn’t detract at all from the quality or attractiveness of the shirt, just confused me a little because of the stretch advertised in the labeling.<br>  Either way this is a very sharp shirt you can wear with a tie to dress it up, or a few buttons down without the tie, maybe even untucked if you wish. Still looks good either way. It’s nice and light, as well as breathable which is something we can all appreciate when the temperature rises, or when you find yourself at a stuffy event.<br>  Overall good fit, good packaging, hit it with an iron or steamer for a few minutes, toss on a tie and you’re ready to go. It will have you looking sharp in no time.

  I was surprised to see this shirt was made in in Ethiopia, first time I ever had anything made there. The quality is standard Van Heusen. I didn’t find anything particularly stretchy in the collar, it did have some give, but don’t expect it to stretch like women’s leggings. I found the lighter patches along the tops of the shoulders a bit distracting, but the look is plainly evident in the listing pics – check out the pics of the models back. My 16.5” neck/34”-35” sleeves were perfectly sized. It’s a regular fit, but for me it fit close to that of a fitted shirt, this one was not at all boxy. I wish they would stop using pins in the packaging, other than that the shirt did not disappoint.

  This is a great shirt. It's made with an ultra soft material that is lightweight and comfortable to wear on hot or cold days. It looks good with a suit and under a jacket as well. It washes well and only needs a light ironing. It's a vivid white and there are no flaws that I can find. 4 stars.<br><br>*If this review helped you make an informed choice about this product in any way I would appreciate it if you take a moment of your time and let me know by hitting the Helpful button and letting me know.

  You can never have enough white shirts so I picked this one up for my husband. He’s 5.10 and about 210 lbs the fit is perfect on him. It is on the thinner side and needed  a t shirt underneath but other than that it’s a nicely made shirt with good quality. He looks so handsome in it with his black suit on ! I washed it on the delicate cycle, and low setting for the dryer took it out as soon as it done and no ironing was needed.

  I'm always excited to try out a new Van Heusen.<br><br>This regular fit is indeed regular - not too athletic anywhere and can handle a little bit of ""gut"".<br>Finishes, seams, touch and feel, color - all up to par with this brands track record - good plus.<br>I don't really notice the stretch collar feature unless I try stretching it by hand - but it certainly doesn't hurt.<br><br>I got the 32''-33'' sleeve - a little short for me at 6' tall.<br>This shirt handled the first round of laundry perfectly. Strong buy recommendation!

  For $20 (at time of review), this is a really nice dress shirt. The color is saturated and the material is comfortable and nice without looking cheap. Fit as expected. Perfect work or church staple. The flex fit is more comfortable for my husband than the more structured shirts. Would recommend, especially for the price. In my experience, this brand holds up to washing really well.

  This is the size my husband wears in dress shirts and this shirt matched his body type to the T (5’ 8” 165). It wasn’t too loose or too tight. The stitching around the cuffs and buttons were well stitched. The material is soft almost silky in texture. The collar  and color is just as advertised in the picture.

  These are excellent modern versions of a classic men's dress shirt. Sizing is as expected, which is of course par for the course for a venerable brand like Van Heusen.<br><br>Flex feature improves comfort. Can be washed and cared for at home, but looks best when professionally cleaned and pressed.

  Van Heusen makes a good shirt, and I've owned them and Arrow for many years. This shirt is a continuation of the line, well made, good value, comfortable, full cut. It's nice enough to wear with a suit, or for a more casual look without a tie. You get classic looks, quality and price. A good value.

  Other shirts I've bought have shrunk when dry cleaned making them very difficult to button the top button to wear a tie.  So far these shirts have not shrunken significantly.  Hope that continues.

  My only issue with this shirt is the material it's made of. I just don't like this stretchy blend of cotton and polyester. It's thin and doesn't feel natural. I would pick a 100% cotton shirt over this one any day.

  Great shirt with comfortable and perfect fit. Great material that looks amazing. I don’t own many dress shirts and though this was free I now want to go purchase more options.

  This shirt feels to be of the cheapest material, and does not feel at all like ""stretch"" material. The shirt is also SEE THROUGH in white. Meaning, you can actually see your skin through it. Not a quality dress shirt.

  Fits as expected, workmanship seems to be good.  Material is good, smooth and not flimsy.  Buttons are tight.

  The dress shirt is good, especially for the price. The only thing is that the material its very thin.

  Bought this for my husband. It fits well and he likes that the neck expands just a little making wearing a tie more comfortable.

  I have ordered 2 Blue frost shirts and both had different flaws. The first one the top button was not aligned properly and the second one the cuffs was cut way to small. I wear Van Heusen shirts all the time specifically this style and i have never had any issues like this. The fabric just didnt seem right to me either. I question the sellers product legitimacy.

  Purchased for my husband to wear to work at a large box store. He has wide shoulders and long arms and he said the future was perfect and the shirts give him great range of motion for work and they are very comfortable.

  The color is nice, totally subjective I know but I like it, fit and finish are very good. It appears so be fairly sturdy, I like to roll my sleeves up to the elbow and every now and then my bony elbows will rip the sleeve open if it doesn't ride up when I bend my arm. With this Van Heusen Dress shirt so far so good.  Each time I've worn this one, recently, we've had 90 degree plus days, yet I don't feel uncomfortable wear and working in, it is not sticking too me unlike some shirts. The collar is a good fit for me, that is a big deal for me as it is hard to find a shirt that has long enough arms, a good chest size and not too tight or too loose in the neck. Most off the shelf shirts that fit elsewhere try to strangle me or make me look as though I have lost too much weight too quickly. Bottom line, I like this shirt.

  It is amazing how much a little stretch material in a dress shirt to make it much more comfortable. I found that the cut of the shirt was perfect, it has a tailored fit. But still enough room in the collar. I’m 5’ 6”, 165 and wearing a size 15.<br><br>I also like how it is styled. Clean white, fabric doesn’t seem to hold stains, and the collar lays nicely.
