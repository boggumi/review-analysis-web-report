sentence,sentiment
"It's a pretty good, inexpensive casual or business casual shirt",1
Basic with few extras but pretty good,1
It fits as expected and is comfortable but there are some minor finish issues and it lacks what other shirts in this range have,2
"For example, it has no side pleats in back and doesn't have a box pleat below the yoke",0
It also doesn't have a hanging loop but I don't care about that,0
If you do you'll be disappointed,2
"So the back is a plain back which is not a problem for me but for some, who wear this to work and want a more finished look it may be an issue",0
If you're wearing it under a coat no problem of course but you'll have to take it off sometime :-D,0
The right cuff buttons are just a tad off so the cuff hem doesn't match exactly,2
This is only noticeable to me and only because I seem to have a habit of messing with them,0
So it isn't visible but can be felt,0
"Also, there are lots of loose threads from production that aren't removed so be ready to give the shirt a quick going over when you get it",2
"Most of them were simply loose pieces and pulled right out, but a couple of the buttons had to have the threads trimmed",2
Not a big deal,0
I'd give it 5 stars but for the few little issues I mention,2
Overall a solid shirt,1
pardon the pun,0
and a great standby for any traditional guy's closet,1
This is one of Van Heusen's better quality made shirts,1
"Although not completely iron free, if you wash and dry with a small load and remove from the dryer and hang immediately you won't require much ironing, none at all for those that wear these as casual shirts",0
I iron everything I wear,0
These are very well made shirts,1
Not thin or see through,0
But not hot and heavy either,0
"They look great with a sport coat and jeans, or as a dress shirt",1
For the price $22,0
"00, you simply can't beat these shirts",1
The colors are vivid,1
It's hard finding Striped Oxford shirts without paying at least $50,1
00 a pop or more,0
These are well worth every cent,1
I'd order more if they had more colors,1
Sizes are true in American sizing,0
So order your regular size without worrying about China's sizing,0
Great shirts,1
I have ordered quite a few of these shirts the past year,0
"So, I guess that the odds of me receiving one that was flawed was bound to happen",2
The issue is that I bought this shirt the end of February as a gift for my son in law,0
He did not wear the shirt right away because he was asked to work from home due to Covid19 the past ten weeks,0
Recently he wore the shirt and then washed it only to discover the unfinished seems at the cuff of each arm,0
It is past the time frame for me to return the shirt to the vender nor am I able to attempt the return,2
I would exchange this shirt if I could,2
Its disappointing,2
Darn Covid19,0
I have had a difficult time finding shirts that fit just right and are well constructed,1
I usually like Van Heusen and these shirts are no different,0
"The fit is great, neck size is good and sleeve length is great",1
"The material is a little on the heavy side, in a good way and all of the stitching feels durable",1
"I really like the collar on these, after buttoning them down they hold their shape well and look good with a sweater or jacket",1
"I have not worn them with a tie yet, but they do button snuggly but not too tightly",2
I originally bought one shirt to test it out,0
I have since bought two more in other colors so I can add them to my regular rotation,0
For the price I think these are fantastic,1
"I?™m 6???? 180lbs, fit",0
I purchased the blue 16,0
"5, 34/35 which fits me well, which includes the sleeve length",0
This my review:,0

#NAME?,2
RECOMMENDATION:,0
"Not the best shirt out there, the fabric feels so rough, it does not feel high quality",2
I don?™t recommend it,2
I bought two shirts as a backup for when they would be needed for work,1
I wore the blue striped shirt twice,0
It's only been washed once,0
"The second time I wore it, I felt it split 3"" on the left side by the seem",0
It's a good looking and comfortable shirt,1
I just won't buy them again,2
I can't contact the buyer and return it because it's over a month since being bought,2
So much for planning ahead and having shirts ready when needed,0
I rarely dress up but am going to a relative's wedding where I'll have to wear a coat and tie to 2 different events,0
I'm more a jeans and flannel shirt guy,0
"I do have an older, but nice, blazer and needed to build a wardrobe around it",0
"Although I haven't worn it anywhere yet, but it fits great and looks good",1
I don't think I'll be embarrassing the family or myself,0
I also bought a light blue Van Heusen shirt for the alternate night,0
"Now, I just need to find a tie",0
"I needed a semi-dressy oxford cloth shirt that I could wear with a tie to church on Sunday, as well as without a tie for general ""business casual"" use",0
"I have had good luck with this brand in the past, and with Amazon's guarantees and ability to return if unsatisfied, I decided to give it a try",1
This is a VERY nice shirt,1
"Irons up very well, and it's well constructed to take a tie-- or NO tie",1
"The buttons are top quality, well sewn, and the fit was exactly as expected",1
I liked this shirt so much that after a month I just ordered a second one,1
Another quality Van Heusen dress shirt for my 'collection',1
"The collection starts at 16"" then 16",0
"5, then 17, then 17",0
"5, so I skipped 18 for this 18",0
They're too small to wear and too good to get rid of,2
I keep thinking one of these years I'll lose some weight,0
"These shirts are great, fit well",1
not too loose not too tight,0
and the best part is the sleeves really are 36-37,0
I always tell people I have monkey arms and it's so hard to get sleeves that are the correct size without getting Tall,0
not as common as it should be,0
or 2 XL which are then like wearing a tent,0
"These are perfect, just wish they were in a few more colors other than shades of blue",1
"I wore this shirt 1 time, then I washed it on a cold gentle cycle, delicate dryer both are large capacity, but I only washed 1 other shirt, and 2 pairs of pants and both cuff sleeves have completely fallen apart",2
The fabric literally shredded,2
Extremely poor construction,2
I should have realized it when threads wear coming off both sleeves the first time I wore it,2
I have added 3 pic's to show the shady workmanship,0
"I am not sure if I can get my money back, but I can prevent someone else from buying the terrible product, then I have done my job",2
Buyer BEWARE,2
I purchased two of these shirts and they wrinkle pretty bad compared to other shirts these days,2
I take them out of the dryer before it stops and hang them,0
Even doing this they are hard to iron to get all of the wrinkles out and after wearing for a little while they look like you have slept in them,2
"Nice material, good fit, nice style and such",1
just the wrinkling is my problem,0
And I am not expecting them to be wearable out of the dryer,2
I bought four of these shirts in different colors,0
They are fabulous,1
"The material seems high quality, they look great, and fit perfectly",1
"I'm on the small side, and trying to get dress shirts, much less sharp-looking dress shirts that fit is increasingly difficult",2
Ant to get these shirts at this price is near-unimaginable,1
"The sleeves are not 34"", but it is an ok shirt",0
Definitely runs small,2
I wouldn't recommend,2
I?™m fairly gentle with my clothes and I?™ve never had anything like this happen before,0
"After first wash, cuffs became horribly frayed and mangled at the edges - had to end up cutting off several loose and frayed threads from both cuffs",2
"I usually roll up my sleeves and I might make a mending project out of it, but I shouldn?™t have to",0
"For the record, care instructions say machine wash is fine",0
"I have a V shape and prefer button-down collar, tapered fit shirts",0
Getting difficult to find tailored fit button-down collar dress shirts that don't look cheap,2
Very pleased with look and feel,1
I wear a 15 1/2  32-33,0
Nice garment,1
I couldn?™t wait to wear after its arrival,0
"However, it had a lot of loose threads",2
Staff that was assigned to ?œclean it??did a lousy job,0
I took care of it but it was a nuisance,2
Got a beautiful shirt  after that little trimming,0
The shirt is very nice,1
"Comfortable, fits well and  does not wrinkle",1
I ordered 34/35 sleeve length and it is the longest sleeve I?™ve ever owned,0
Have to roll up and cuff to wear otherwise I look like a pirate with billowing sleeves,0
Actual measurement is closer to 37,0
Useless as a work/office dress shirt unless you are Captain Jack Sparrow,2
Good fit at the neck/chest area,1
But would definitely consider getting the waist and sleeves tailored,2
"The quality of stitching isn't superb, but adequate",0
Especially considering the casual nature of the shirt,0
Van Heusen is consistently dependable,0
This shirt was what I was looking for,1
"It is dressy enough to wear with a tie and jacket, yet it also goes well with jeans",0
I definitely recommend it,1
Junk and paper thin shirt,2
I had to return two shirts as they had not been sewn at the edges of the sleeve cuff leaving a raw open fabric edge,2
They say easy care but they are heavily wrinkled straight out of the drier,2
Never buy again,2
The shirt comes out of the dryer looking pretty good,1
I always iron them but it is much easier with a shirt that already looks pretty good,2
The seams are straight and the fit is good,1
The seams on both sleeve cuffs came un-stitched with first laundering,2
The shirt is unusable,2
Update: Shirt replaced quickly with easy return of the original,0
"If this one holds up, I will update rating to 5 stars",0
"Very nice color, excellent fit",1
Good wearability and thank god it comes in many sizes,1
"I get compliments wearing these Van Heusen shirts, mainly because they fit",1
"Plus, THEY LOOK GREAT, and the collars are very sturdy and clean-looking",0
I love the way these fit,1
"My husband wore this shirt twice?”washed on cold gentle cycle, delicate dryer as all his work shirts are",0
The cuffs have completely fallen apart on both sleeves,2
Not just the stitching either?”the fabric itself has literally shredded,2
Extremely poor construction,2
"This shirt is really nice looking, well made and wrinkle-free",1
"Really, wrinkle-free",1
So why doesn't Van Heusen make more like this? I don't know,1
I certainly would buy a few more in solid colors,1
"Now other Van Heusen shirts? Trashy, not wrinkle-free, not true to size and cheap looking although the same price",0
Go figure,1
Bought this for my husband to wear to our son?™s rehearsal dinner,0
It looked very good with black dress pants and a tie,1
"The shirt is made out of a very nice material, very easy to press",1
"These fit as expected since you order by neck and sleeve size, it makes no sense to buy ones that are just s, m, lg, xl and expect a good fit",0
I noticed some threads loose on the left shoulder when I wore it the first time,2
I thought they were just loose threads that could be cut,2
Wore it a second time and went to cut the threads they are coming out in several places,2
Very dissapointed,2
This shirt waste of money,2
The shirt fit great but one of the seams ripped out after 6 months of little wear,2
I can?™t recommend this shirt even though I have always had good luck with Van Heiden,1
"Brought these shirts for my husband, he has broad shoulders so it fitted well there but waist area was abit loose",0
Overall it was good,1
Not easy care or wrinkle free,2
Disappointed,2
My husband wore out his Van Heusen dress shirt - he liked the look and fit that much,1
"So glad we were able to order a new one online during our state's ""Stay At Home"" order",1
This shirt is great,1
Just as advertised and I am happy as I didn't have to wait in a line,1
"In fact, I'm ordering more",1
"I was happy to find the size, quality, and color needed",1
I bought this shirt for my husband to wear to semi-dressy events,0
"It would be good for others to wear at anytime, but he is a tee shirt kind of guy so I needed a comfy and easy care shirt",0
It fits well and I am happy,1
"got this for my husband and it fit true to size, and it was half the price from big name stores, which is even better",1
And it fit as we expected it too,1
And the color looks good on him,1
No complaints,0
Really like the shirt,1
It is a little snug through the chest and waist,0
These seem to run a bit smaller than my other brand dress shirts of the same size,0
Van Huesen had the best dress shoes,1
"great fabric, feel and amazing well made",1
My Husbands fave' ~ look great on him,1
PJ,0
I ordered this shirt because I have one just like it -exactly the same,1
Older one is 5 years old and still like new,0
Was replacing some others from other manufacturers with same stripe as collars started to wear from chin whiskers,0
"Oh, I do have many other shirts for all seasons blue pin striped are my casual favorites",2
"An inexpensive shirt, and you get what you pay for",1
"The fit is a little blousy, and the fabric a bit thin",0
"Getting hard to find these traditional striped shirts in a button down style, so this one fills a need, but I doubt it will stand up well to repeated laundering",2
"Still, the price was right",0
Husband wears these types of shirts to work,0
He likes them for their comfort,1
I like them because they don?™t need ironing,1
Defective stitching on pocket,2
See photo,0
Returning shirt,0
A little larger than I thought it would fit,0
Other than that it is a nice shirt,1
Not super well made but for the price a good shirt,1
I received a lot of shirts at the same time and tried them on,0
This shirt was the same size but was a lot bigger,0
It will do but not satisfied with the size,2
Its not a heavy dress shirt,0
More light then heavy,0
happy with it,1
Better then expected for the price,1
"I find it very difficult to find good dress shirts with a 18 inch collar and 34-35 sleeve, but these exactly fit the bill",1
"They are good looking, wrinkle resistant shirts",1
Unfortunately i didn't try the shirt one right after i purchased it,0
This was a back up and its been way over a month since my purchase,2
When i put it on for the first time the sleeves and cuffs were too small,2
I couldn't button the cuffs,2
The left button on the collar fell off before the end of the day,2
"Make sure you try it on the same day you get it , even if it is a backup",0
Wrinkles bad,2
Unlike the same model but has pinpoint on the collar,0
This one comes out immediately from the dryer and requires it to be ironed,0
Not good,2
"Arrived on time, and they are a perfect fit for a paunchy old guy with a 17 1/2 inch neck size",1
I must say that I was pleasantly pleased with these purchases,1
Bought five at same size  and I am just please at the fit especially in neck and sleeves,1
Tailoring is nat bad either,0
It appears shirt manufactures are saving on material,2
tight in all the wrong places,2
Love it,1
Will buy another,1
A true taylored shirt,0
Would be A+ if it had a button down collar,0
Beautiful shirt,2
Nice fabric,1
Excellent fit &amp,1
quality,1
Washes nicely,0
No wrinkles,2
My Hubby loves these shirts,1
Easy wash &amp,1
dry with little or no ironing,0
Purchased this shirt for my husband and it?™s a great quality shirt,1
I ordered a couple of these shirts online because I could not find my exact size locally,0
16 x 34/35,0
The fit is pretty good,1
Just on the loose side,0
a tad,0
"but maybe, after a wash, they'll be just right",0
The fabric is not super heavy,0
"but not see-through, either",2
I like the weight,1
"Overall, happy with the shirt",1
Basic dress shirt without all the frills,0
"This was exactly to fit, I wear it for work",0
I love it,1
Great material and doesn't shrink or fade after a few washes,1
"I wore this shirt 1 time, then I washed it and both cuff sleeves have completely fallen apart",2
The fabric literally shredded,2
Extremely poor quality,2
Please stay away from this,1
Waste of ?’°,2
Great quality,1
Shirt was a perfect fit,1
Wore to compliment my wife?™s dress for a night out event,1
Nice fit but a lot of loose threads hanging out all over the shirt,0
"After the second laundering, a buttonhole on the front frayed and is now essentially unusable",2
"Of course, I noticed this after the return date, so now face an expensive repair",2
Beware,0
"The quality and design of this dress shirt is extraordinary, especially given the cost",2
"Well done, Van Heusen",1
Seems very well made and fit exactly like it should,1
pretty  - nice material  fast shipping and well packed,1
This is a really nice looking shirt,1
Which I used to dress up,0
The shirt fit fine,1
My problem is the cuffs unraveled on the first time my husband wore it,2
Unfortunately it was past the date of making a return,2
Poor quality in sewing appears to be the cause,2
The seam did not fix the fabric it was supposed to hold,2
What a waste of money,2
Very nice shirt,1
Well made and very comfortable,1
An exceptionally competent shirt at a fair price,1
La mejor opciÃ³n en camisas lindas y de fÃ¡cil planchado es VAN HAUSEN,0
"Looks great, fits great and arrived quickly",1
Cannot find 18 neck with a size 30/32 shirt anywhere,0
This one fit my boyfriend perfectly,1
Quality shirt,1
Only issue was LOTS of loose threads,2
I had to check each seam with a pair of scissors in hand to clean up all the dangling threads,2
This shirt is too short,2
Not long enough,0
Wish to return,2
Please advise,0
Nice quality,1
Fits great,1
Husband really likes this shirt,1
Shirt was as described by seller,0
A few loose threads that had not been cut off which is not unusual for a shirt in this price range,2
overall very pleased,1
Fits just right,1
Will probably buy more in other colors and patterns,1
"Needed a tall, but the shirt is quality",1
Well-made shirt,1
Feels and looks like an expensive dress shirt,1
Took correct measurements of myself and it fit great,0
The fit was not at all as I expected,2
The sleeves were way too long and the shirt was very baggy all around,2
So I ordered a different size and it fit very  well,0
This shirt was bought to replace the same shirt bought 20 years ago,0
Looks and feels to be the same product,1
We'll let you know if this one lasts 20 years,0
Van  Heusen is a great brand,1
The fit is exactly right,1
Comfortable but Not long enough,0
Barely tucks in my pants,0
Love the shirt,1
I wish I could get some others in different patterns in my size,1
Good quality and one of the few items where I ordered what I normally wear and it came in just right,1
This shirt fit him perfectly and he loves it,1
These shirts were a great value but they come out of the dryer wrinkled,0
Shirt had a nice look and was a good value,1
Not a no-iron shirt,0
"A neat and hard to find color pattern, but be prepared to get the iron out",0
Straight from the dryer its wrinkled,2
Quality good,1
Fit good,1
Holds up washing,2
Would buy again,1
"I liked this shirt, fits good, quality built",1
"I Love this shirts, but as they are too small for my husbands neck, I am returning and ordering a larger size",0
They are truly beautiful,1
Material is not the greatest like Tommy Hilfiger shirts but it is right for the price,0
I was Very Pleased,1
", THANK YOU",0
poor fit buy a size or two up,2
Good fit,1
Need to add another button to the bottom of the shirt to help keep it straight when tucked in your pants,2
Awesome quality great value,1
"good fit, easy  to move in",1
Fit is a bit snug,0
Order up a size,0
"Shirt wears fine, unfortunately though after about the third dry cleaning the blue stripes are now bleeding into the white fabric",0
Same professional dry cleaners I?™ve used for decades and not had this happen to any other dress shirt or garment,2
"Disappointing to say the least, two months use and now into the trash",2
"I really love this shirt its fit perfectly, it is just perfect for me",1
Thanks a lot,0
"I like design,color,brandname",1
"Beautiful shirt, great colors, fits very well and the price is very good",1
"Van Huesen shirts have been around for a long time, there's a good reason",1
The feel of the fabric and the fit is not as expected,0
"With only wearing this a few times, the shirt should not have lose threads",2
"I should have returned it prior to the cut off time, but unfortunately I procrastinated",2
:-,0
Fits great,1
Just what I needed,1
I ordered 18,0
5/36 -37 tall,0
Shirt would be fine except the tail is too short,0
Quality fabric and fit,1
Quality not as expected,0
Buttons loose,2
stitching coming undone in the shoulder seem??,2
This brand used to be of better quality,1
Quality was good,1
Fits great,1
Good value,1
Not wrinkle free,0
Nice color on shirt,1
Fit was perfect,1
Material was a bit thin,0
Not the highest thread count either,0
A decent everyday shirt,0
Nice product,1
High quality,1
Reasonably priced,1
Purchased the shirt for my husband for work,0
One of the collar buttons was missing when it arrived,2
"Fortunately had an extra button and sewed it on, but disappointing that the shirt arrived with the button missing,",2
Looks great,1
Nice fit and feel,1
Good Shirt,1
Great quality but too long and loose around waist,0
Looks and fits great tucked in,1
Fits great,1
Excellent shirt,1
"Not bad but it is a bit loose , buy half a size smaller than your actual size , quality is good and very comfortable , packiging and delivery were excellent",0
Great Shirt,1
"Perfect shirt, perfect size and fit, reasonable cost, no hunting in store for right size and style",1
Exactly as show in photo,0
Like,1
Very poor quality have always bought Van Huesen maybe not anymore,2
WOULD WOULD BUY AGAIN,1
NICE SHIRT,1
"Excellent, Thanks, Michael, 2019",1
I have been buying Van Huesen shirts for a long time,0
They are good to wear,1
Very good quality and good price,1
Fits as expected,0
"Good feel, soft material, easy to iron and looks sharp",1
Really nice shirt,1
I got one but the size is completely not fitting for me,0
The shirt,0
"Opened the package, put the shirt in the wash, cuffs shredded",2
Poor stitching quality,2
I thought about reaching out to the manufacturer before posting a review but really they should do quality testing before they ship these things out,2
My wife is working on stitching up the cuffs,2
"Nice looking dress shirt, but needs to be ironed ?˜•",0
size was exactly correct,0
shirt fits fine,1
"The blue stripes are quite clear, soft blue",1
Really did not like the way this fit,2
Much to big,2
It washes well and doesn't shrink at all,1
Still looks good after two washings,1
"I'm generally pretty happy with Van Heusen shirts, and this is no exception",1
Works with both dress pants and jeans,0
"If they ever come up with a shirt that irons itself, I'll bump the review up to five stars",0
Really like the color of this shirt,1
It's great,1
"Good fit, good material",1
"Fits well, very attractive, soft and comfortable material",1
Would buy again,1
Basic dress shirt that fits perfectly,1
Comfortable breathable material,1
Like the quality and variety of colors and print,1
Fits well and I like it,1
Product was satisfactory,1
Met my expectations,1
Thanks,1
Great shirt with a perfect fit,1
"A little too wide, it is a regular fit but still a little wide even for that",2
Great quality and look though,1
I love the shirt,1
It is comfortable and looks great with navy slacks,1
"I live in South Georgia, so it's definitely not a summer shirt",0
It fits as expected,0
"It fit as expected, but as a tall person it is a tad shorter than I want, but not so bad that it renders the shirt unwearable",0
Nice,1
would've given it 5 stars but the sleeve length was just a tad short,0
but acceptable,0
"If you are on-the-fence between sleeve length options, go with the longer sleeve",0
"Otherwise, fits well and looks good",1
Quality is not so good and strands of thread are coming out on many places of the shirt,2
It is not really easy care,2
It definitely needs ironing after washing and drying,2
I don?™t consider that easy care,0
"Great shirt, great price, bought a second shirt",1
These are a great value,1
You could easily pay two or three times as much for a shirt of this quality,1
I am wearing one right now,0
Spend a bit more and get a good fit at others,2
"The Van Heusen  brand has obviously gone the way of what once were 1st class producers such as Bell and Howell, Arrow, etc",1
good product,1
I wore this shirt three times and the sleeve stitching completely unraveled,2
Poor quality,2
Good,1
"I have always like Van Heusen shirts, and have been buying them for many years",0
This particular shirt was on sale and probably because  it has issues,2
"After the very first wash the  cuffs came apart, it turned out to be a wear once shirt",2
"Fit is perfect, colors vibrant, and tailoring is very good",1
Quality and perfect size,1
"Fabric: soft, neck: just right",1
Great quality at a more than reasonable price,1
"Good price, authentic product",1
Love this line of shirts,1
have owned many,1
"This shirt wears well, and looks great when starched and pressed",1
has the appearance of a shirt costing much more,1
The collar size and arm lenth are correct,0
However it is wa to big around the abdominal area,2
Unless you are obese better to get slim fit,0
The headline is the review:,0
"Good quality, good fit, good appearance, good price, delivered promptly",1
Will buy more as the occasion merits,1
First of all they have different size criteria and had to actually have my brother measure his neck size,1
"After measuring it well, and choosing the closest size from this list, this is way too large to fit in",0
Satisfied customer,1
Decent shirt for the price,1
Fits just like every other shirt I own with the same measurements,0
"If I can find the same shirt in different patterns, I'll get a couple more",1
Great fit,1
He loved it,1
Love this brand and this shirt,1
nice shirt,1
Can't wear it,0
Perfect shirt for my body size,1
Great fit and crisp dress shirt,1
Loove,2
Nice shirt but I wish it really was a 16 1/2 x 33,0
The sleeves are way too long &amp,2
it looks like wind breaker on a windy day,0
Strudy material and you can't beat the price,2
"Finally  , nice",1
Good quality for casual Fridays,1
I like the way it fits and I like the way it looks,1
Received great compliments from friends,1
SHIRTS RUN VERY SMALL-IF YOUR SELECTING 15 OR 16 NECK GO ONE UP IN SIZE,0
Perfect as I want,1
Van Heusen shirts just seem to fit great and look great,1
It's a well made shirt and I'm glad i got it for a very good price,1
Fit amazing but had a small whole on the sleeve,0
Great quality and stripes spacing and color suttle yet dressy,1
"Very well made, washes and wears well",1
"I've never had any problems with Van Heusen shirts, my favorite",1
"I opened one shirt-it is paper thin, very poor quality and about two sizes too small",2
What happened to Van Heusen?  I bought four of these and wasted my money,2
"The boxes were left out in pouring rain, instead of putting under the covered porch, so returning is not even possible",0
"love these shirts, excellent quatlity for the price",1
Great shirt at a great price,1
Good looking,1
durable I would guess,1
Van Heusen shirts are very consistent over past 30 years,1

Really nice,1
Perfect fit,1
Very nice looking shirt,1
Fit nicely too,1
It was too small,2
This was a gift and he loved it,1
A decent shirt for the money,0
Normally I?™m pretty happy with Van Heusen /Amazon clothes but I just bought this shirt and there were over a dozen loose threads/strings that I had to cut off,1
Seems like a poor sewing job,2
Don?™t waste your money,2
Bought this shirt for my husband and the cuffs frayed after the first wash,0
Returned it and got a replacement,2
Washed that one and the same thing happened even before wearing,0
Poor quality,2
"The shirt arrived bunched up in an envelope, torn",0
"The size 18 neck, 33/34 sleeve made it a Big and Tall, so had too much volume around the middle that I didn't need",0
Returned it for full credit from Amazon,0
Great,1
This shirt is exactly as pictured,0
It was true to size and is classic fit shirt,1
the quality is very good and durable,1
Has been washed several times and has not lost its color and did not shrink,1
Great shirt,1
Good quality product for the price,1
Would buy it again,1
Fits a big man well,0
Had the shirt laundered with extra starch it looked like the shirt you could buy,0
Great shirt and actually fit as expected,1

"Good quality, looks good and fit as expected",1
Well tailored and nice material,1
Coler was different than anything I had and very versitle,1
Nice pinpoint color,1
I washed it on the delicate setting with some of my other work shirts and both cuffs separated,2
Unwearable,2
This item is complete garbage,2
My husband wore this shirt one time and the material on the inside of the neck is coming unstitched,2
He really liked the shirt but it is not made well,2
"Shirt is well made, and very comfortable",1
"The shirt fits perfectly, and is beautiful",1
The shirt was sewn with parts of the shirt's material on the wrong side,2
This is a very basic part of sewing to sew the garment with the material facing the same side,0
Good price,1
Nice shirt,1
I love the quality of this brand,1
As expected,0
Good product,1
Good quality,1

Nice Shirt,1
Wore it to church Sunday and was thinking of getting another one in a different color,1
Ok,0
Worked well,1
Nice shirt but the second button on the sleeve slit is stupid,0
Other than that this is my third button down Van Heusens shirt,0
Bought this shirt for my husband,0
The cornflower blue pinstripes are gorgeous,1
He looks so handsome in this and I think it's one of his new favorites,1
"It's also soft but ""manly""",0
An overall great buy,1
good fit and well made,1
It was used for work and church,0
I have been wearing these shirts for years at work each day,0
"Very good quality, fits well, very comfortable, wrinkle free, once dried, just fold them well and press them in the pile of clothing and they come out neat looking",1
I strongly recommand,1
I am very pleased with all 3 Van Heisenberg Dress shirts,1
They fit perfectly and I could not,1

Nice shirts for the money,1

"great shirt, looks and fits great",1
"It was a nice looking shirt and my husband has a lot of Van Heusen shirts that fit great if we get the right size, but somehow the size I thought I ordered was not the right size",2

Smart shirt that you can withstand the daily grind in,1
Holds up wonderfully in the washer and dryer,1
Not a slim fit if that is what you are looking for,2
Great color and awesome fit,1
Must iron after wash but good material,0
Excellent fits perfect,1

nice shirt,1
"Good fit, good quality fabric, nice pattern",1
One star taken away for a poorly made buttonhole,2
One side of the hole has no stitches at all leading to loose threads,2
Did not bother to return it,2
Really nice shirt,1
Holds a pressing very well,1
Thinner material - would have liked to seen slightly heavier/denser material used,0
Collar is perfect for a point style,1
Stripes are very crisp but not overly bright,0
Sleeves are perfect length,1
Price is fair and I would buy it again,1
"Received in just two days, and I no longer visit department stores",0
still the best classic dress shirt made,1
Very nice shirt,1
I ordered the same size as always 17' neck / 33' sleeve,0
Sleeves are cut right,1
I cannot button the neck,2
May be mislabeled or a factory mistake,2
Returning is cost prohibitive,2
Nice made shirt though,1
I can wear it open collar with sport jacket,0
Great colour and fit,1
These shirts are very good and fit well,1
It is pretty sad that there are so few manufacturers who sell their shirts the old way: by neck size and sleeve length,2
Unfortunately we are not a S/M/L/XL society,0
Great purchase,1
"I'm 6'0, 195 and this shirt fits great even at 180",0
I've bought them for years at the outlet mall,0
when this particular size and color is in,0
They're a no brainer and I wear them to work,0
Looks great on my son,1
"Nice shirt, fit well",1
great,1
A little loose but after a few washes it should be just fine,1
GOOD,1
This appears to be a well made shirt but it is certainly not no-iron,2
Even taking it out of the dryer it is not wearable without ironing,2
I will send it to the commercial laundry from now on,2
I normally wear a 15 1/2 33-34 but of course they didnt have this size when I ordered,0
"So, I took a chance and ordered a 16 33-34 and it fit like a 15 1/2  Van Heusen is hit and miss that way sometimes",0
"Overall, its a decent shirt",1
Great looking Oxford Cloth dress shirt,1
like I used to wear 50+ years ago,0
Great fit and dignified simplicity for any well dressed man,1
Tall men need the extra arm length and this shirt provides,1
Sorry that this shirt is 65% polyester - 35% cotton,0
It is a hot shirt in the summer,0
The sleeves seems to be a bit long but not enough to request alteration or return,0
Shirt looks exactly like the picture and fits well,1
We have not had problems with wrinkles after several washings and the shirt is as vibrant as the day we bought it,1
"I am 6'1"", 255lbs",0
I re-ordered 16-16,0
"5, 36/37 and they fit great",0
I find that IZOD generally fits comfortably for bigger guys,0
like myself,0
I have not washed or had the shirt pressed yet,0
But so far so good,1
I washed this shirt for the first time and it was not wrinkle free,0
Another shirt from Van Heusen labeled easy care that I bought awhile ago came out of the dryer wrinkle free so my washing protocol was fine,2
Am very disappointed that this shirt does not hang up wrinkly free,2
Shirt looks good and at a better price then in stores,1
Very good,1
Stitching on one of the sleeves was irregular with lots of threads hanging out,2
Otherwise a great shirt,1
I always like to wear this kind of model  shirt,0
I feel very confortable and good looking when I used it,1
"This shirt is too large, I bought the smallest size and it looks like a XL",2
Too small and too tight based on other Van Heusen men's dress shirts that I have bought,2
great shirt fit right wrinkle free tough durable shirt would buy it again,1
Always depend on a perfect fit with Van Heusen,1
Great shirt,1
Returned,2

The shirt is too large for me and I give it to my father,2
And it fits,1
I purchased 2 Van Husen striped shirts from a department store and like most consumers reported,0
"After the first wash, the thread on the chest line began to come lose",2
"Now, it looks like the shirted has the stressed look",2
Not a Good look in Executive meetings,2
"My other shirt threads came out on the size, and the material simply tore",2
"Over owned 100s of Van Husen shirts, some wear out at the elbow, over had that a lot, but that's after 2 yrs and few washes",2
"The colors do not bleed, but the material gets very weak of regular office environment wear",2
I think Van Husen is officially off my purchase list,2
I ordered 3 of these shirts as they were on sale,0
Unfortunately I made the mistake of not washing just one to see what it looked like,2
They all look wrinkled no matter how you wash and dry them,2
Even my wife who is not that picky says they always look wrinkled,2
I'm not making a comparison with shirts taken to the cleaners but other shirts that are on the market,0
My advice is to buy a shirt from LL Bean and then one of these,2
I can guarantee that you will want to send this one back,2
"Sure the ones from bean are more expensive but they are much better quality, will last twice as long and yes are  actually wrinkle free",0
"If you want a shirt to leave untucked with jeans on casual day at work, yes you can get away with one of these",0
I gave them 2 stars because I've seen worse,2
"Very happy with the quality and shape of this shirt, but fit is a little tighter then normal, so I exchanged for 1/2 size",1
larger neck,2
"This is a nice shirt, pretty much just what I was looking for",1
My only suggestion is they be a little more precise on sleeve lengths,2
"An inch makes a difference so I would prefer a 34"" sleeve over a 35"" sleeve and over a 34/35"" sleeve",2
I like the shirt,1
"It fits perfectly, it's well tailored and made",1
It does not come out of the dryer wrinkle free but I've order a garment steamer to hopefully take the wrinkles out,2
"Other than that, I like it very much",1
"I bought it for my husband, and he loved it",1
This shirt is excellent as I expected,1
"The fit was just right, the material and price were excellent and I am completely satisfied",1
I'd like more of this in different colors,1
Sleeves too short,2
"Decent material, not great",0
When I washed the shirt the cuffs on the shirt fell apart,2
Bough this for my fiance,0
"He liked it very much in fit, feel, and color",1
Both cuffs in the shirt came apart with the first washing,0
The quality is horrible,2
Great quality just a little loose for my style,1
Slim fit would be perfect,1
Shirt sleeves are different lengths,2
I gave this to my father in law as a gift for Christmas and he just opened it,0
Apparently too late to return it deadline was 01/31 and it is now 02/04 - so now he is stuck with a useless shirt,2
very disappointing,2
"I haven't worn these business shirts much, so here's the main point: after being tailor measured, Van Heusen fit better than a competitor",2
"But at the time of purchase, there was a limited selection of colors and patterns by Van Heusen on Amazon",0
for this exact shirt style,0
Which is how I found a problem with fit from a competitor shirt maker,0
"I bought this shirt recently after receiving 2 other shirts in different colors for Christmas, to replace 3 other long sleeve shirts that are past their prime which I gave away to be used as art smocks",0
Very happy with the shirt I purchased plus,1
the two that were Christmas gifts,0
Quality shirt that had a comfortable feel and eye appealing look,1
Loved the color selection and felt the measurement guidance was helpful,1
The size I selected perfectly fit my build,1
I wear a 16,0
"5 36/37 and the shirt was a perfect fit, nice quality",1
Will buy additional colors,1
I husband loved this shirt,1
"It fit as expected, and at a good price",1
"Excellent material, good looking - and truly wrinkle-free",1
"Great, great value",1
Great shirt,1
like it a lot,1
"Great material, worth the price",1
Nice shirt,1
Me agrado fino,0
"Ok, so I'm short and stocky",2
let's get that out the way,2
These 18 1/2 x 32 shirts really fit me well,1
Love the way they feel and I wish they had all colors in stock so I could buy them all in my size,1
Comfortable fit and reasonable delivery,1
"This product looks fine and fits fine, althought the material is very thin",0
"However, after a few drycleanings",0
four or five wearings?,0
", the cuff completely opened up at the end",2
I can't see any signs of threads in there and it looks like a lot of the seams are just glued,2
"Oh well, the price was right",1
If my $200 shirts last 4 years maybe it's right that a $25 shirt lasts 4 months,0
I like this shirt,1
It has sleeves that are long enough for me,2
I wanted something in red because I already had enough blue shirts,0
It was exactly what I wanted,1
"It seems well-made, and should last a few years",1
I can now throw out or donate some other shirts that do not fit well or are worn out,2
"I got this shirt rolled up in a bag without any tags, pins etc",0
"Somebody else returned it, obviously someone smarter than I am I am not a big guy but I have a long torso and arms and all I want is shirts that fit",0
Doesn't sound that difficult but apparently it's impossible I ordered 5 shirts and one fit properly and it wasn't a Van Heusen so guess where I'm buying my next five shirts,0
This is a great looking shirt &amp,1
the size was dead on,0
I wash it with other whites &amp,0
when done hang it on a plastic hanger to almost air dry,0
I then put it in the dryer with a dryer sheet on medium setting for about 10 minutes &amp,0
it comes out dry &amp,0
without wrinkles,0
This shirt fits well is and is as expected as far as quality from Van Heusen,1
I have had many Van Heusen shirts over the years and this one was the same as all others,0
"good quality, good fit ans the sleeves are the length they say they are",1
I will definitely be buying other shirts like this on Amazon,2
"A partir de cierta talla deberÃ­a ser obvio que no soy delgado, nunca dijeron que fuera corte Slim",0
"Muy mal, no la regresÃ© porque prefiero regalarla que seguir perdiendo el tiempo",0
I purchased this shirt and as I always do I wash it before use,0
When I went iron it I noticed a cut in the breast pocket that can?™t be repaired,2
This was a defect in the shirt not caused by the washer,2
I would return for credit but the policy says in new condition,2
I have ordered many Van Heusen shirts in the past and no issue,0
"The shirt is very good as far as quality is concerned, I love the color",1
"As far as the size is concerned, I noticed that at the reverse of the wrapping plastic bag, there are three more additional sizes: Regular, Slim and Fitted",0
I do not understand why these additional sizes are not included in the on line description,2
"I could have had the option to decide what size would have been more addecuate to me, of course the regular fit is not the proper one",0
"La grande variÃ©tÃ© de ce modÃ¨le, sa disponibilitÃ© en format pour moi, grandeur  cou et manches",0
et qualitÃ© du produit non disponible en rÃ©gion,0
"Llevo 15 aÃ±os usando Van Heusen, los cortes y calidad siempre siguen standards",0
Excelentes productos para uso diario en la oficina,1
Garbage,2
I have the grey stripe one and it was fine,1
Second brown stripe one and I have to send it back after one wash,2
"Sa disponibilitÃ© en format pour moi, grandeur  cou et manches",0
et qualitÃ© du produit non disponible en rÃ©gion,0
"Arms are a tad long though, everything else is about the same as any other Van Heusen shirt",0
"Excelente producto en su nivel, impecables acabados y tela de muy buena calidad",1
Muy recomendable,1
La entrega como siempre antes de lo prometido,0
This shirts fits comfortably and the price was right,1
"Perfect fit, not many long sleeve button shirts fit this nicely",1
Very good quality for the price,1
"Muy tersa y suave la tela, buena calidad, muy buen producto",0
En cuanto a la talla ya tenÃ­a otros productos de la marca y las medidas se mantienen uniformes,0
Quality is absolutely garbage,2
Wore the shirt and washed it four times and the cuffs are falling apart,2
Even when I received it brand new I looked at the quality and knew it wouldn't last long,2
Waste of money,2
Very good value,1
