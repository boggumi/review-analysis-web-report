This is basically a good shirt,1
"Most of my shirts are Van Huesen, and I appreciate them",1
"However, ithis was advertised and described as a FLEX  collar, and the collar did not stretch nor flex",2
It had labels on it declaring that it was a Flex collar,0
"I have some Van Huesen shirts with flex flex collars, that have a built-in extendable collaf",0
They are good,1
This one did not stretch,2
Otherwise a good shirt,1
I think the supervisor of the guy over in Bangladesh,0
country of origin,0
"told him to put 275 of the ""FLEX COLLAR"" tags on by lunch time, and the worker, perhaps not being literate, worked hard to get them all affixed",1
This shirt replaced a similar Joseph Fees brand dress shirt,0
"I did have to iron it before the first wear, but since then it's been wash, dry, &amp",0
wear with no worries,1
"I wore this shirt to a job interview, and next thing I know I've moved 2000 miles and I'm making more money than I ever have",1
"Idk if that's the shirt's fault, but it certainly didn't hurt anything",0
This is the very first product review that I have ever written and I am 77 years old,0
"I bought two shirts, one white and one blue and they were delivered separately",0
The white one was in original packaging and was perfect,1
apparently by another supplier,0
The blue shirt is the issue,2
It was delivered in a loose package and it looked like someone had been sleeping in it for a week,2
It was completely wrinkled and out of its original packaging,2
My wife wanted me to return it or take it to the cleaners for pressing but I'm not interested in paying someone to do something that should not be needed,2
My wife agreed to iron the shirt so I hope the wrinkles come out but this is ridiculous,2
The sleeves are supposed to be 36-37 inches,2
Not even close,2
Plus the left sleeve is about 2 inches shorter than the right sleeve,2
The right sleeve is about 34 inches and the left is too short to even button,2
Not a good shirt,2
I returned the other shirt and will keep this because I need a dress shirt for a wedding,0
"But, it will be a one time wear and then junk it",2
"I have always liked Van Heusen shirts,",1
"As they fit well, look good too",1
"I particularly like this color, but that_ a personal",1
preference,1
I highly recommend the quality though,1
"Fits perfect, color and texture is great",1
"Is cut nicely, too",1
"For $22, I'd buy this shirt regularly",1
Some of the other colors were priced for a lot more but I won't spend any more for a shirt I wear to work when I can drive to the mall and spend $10 on the clearance rack for dress shirts,0
This is a decent shirt,1
but there are a few things of note about this shirt:,0
Pros:,1
The neck fit is nice with a little stretch,1
Wrinkle free is great,1
Cons:,2
The shirt came with a small black spot on it that doesn't seem to come out in the wash,2
"By ""regular fit"" they mean huge",0
Like really HUGE,0
"If you are not large person you should look for a ""slim fit"" or ""skinny fit""",0
"This is more of a ""regal fit"" in my opinion",0
"The wrinkle free shirt definitely needs to be ironed, but I expected that",0
The flex neck is very comfortable,1
The shirt fits true to size,1
I could probably use more of a tapered fit,0
I_ not a slim fit,0
", but I ordered the regular classic fit which has plenty of room",0
I ordered 4 shirts,0
I will order more like this if I can find other colors in my size,1
Please note: the first two I ordered from Macy_ were a nightmare,2
When they arrived,0
"the white one had two different size sleeves, as well as different style sleeves",0
I wrote a negative review on Macy_ site and returned it to Macy_ in person,2
The salesperson didn_ ask any questions and didn_ care when I told him the issue,2
I did not want them to resell the shirt,2
"18 neck, 32-33 sleeves",0
"So, I ordered 2 more through Amazon",0
"These two arrived together but one was not in it_ original packaging, and was a mess",2
It was scrunched up in a ball and stuffed in a plastic bag,2
I planned on washing/ironing them first anyway and was thankful they fit and had matching,1
correct,1
style sleeves,0
The issue I think was Christmas time shopping over loud  and I believe Van Heusen is going out of business,2
"The neck is to large, I measured against some other shirts I have and it is over an inch bigger",2
It is not a stretch neck as advertised,2
"The sleeves are short, they are 2 to 3 inches shorter than my other shirts with the same sleeve length",2
"I would send it back but I bought it for an event and I had to wear it, now it is going to Goodwill",2
Don't buy this shirt,2
Very comfortable with a nice fit,1
"The colors are bright and bold, which are perfect for me as an elementary teacher",1
"The only negative I've found is that Purple Haze is awfully close to Hearth, which I had ordered previously",2
I believe the camera flash has left it looking a bit brighter in the demo photo above than it actually appears in real life,0
"I was somewhat disappointed when I put it in my closet and noticed that they were very close shades of one another, with Hearth just having a tinge more red than Purple Haze",2
Looks great,1
packaged well,1
"But as it says the neck stretches or whatever, just know I used to wear a 17 1/2 and needed bigger so I got 18 and with the stretch feature I thought I'd be ok",0
But it still just barely fit,0
I can't imagine my neck went up 2 sizes so I wouldn't really take the stretch part to the bank,0
If you think you need a specific size get that or maybe 1/2 bigger,0
The shirt is the same cut as the shirts I_e bought from the brick and mirror store,0
However the _lassic pink is more lavender than pink,0
"I included a picture of what it looks like compared to my husbands actual pink and purple shirts and as you can tell, it_ light purple",0
"It_ fine, I_l keep the shirt, it_ just annoying since I was trying to replace a pink shirt",2
"In a dress shirt, it's all about the collar",0
"Fabric or prints are always overshadowed by either a sad, weak collar that won't standup or like this shirt, a stiff, vertical collar that stands up to a distinctive profile",0
Plenty of room in my 44 inch mid section and 50 inch chest,0
Ordered longer arms because I am heavier in my upper back and the length is roomy by 1 inch but I expect shrinkage by 1/2 inch,0
Great fit,1
"Compre una camisa Van Heusen, recib√≠ algo que no tiene marca no se exactamente que talla es, no es el producto que solicite, decepcionado de la compra pero sobre todo decepcionado de Amazon de no validar la calidad de los productos que ofrecen",0
This is advertised as a new product but it had already been unpacked and had a stain where a pin was reinserted,2
I_e never had a problem with the other van Huesen shirts I_e bought on amazon,0
Over the years I have had difficulty finding a dress or sport shirt that fits me,0
"I have short, strong arms, a full, strong torso, and full muscular, short neck",0
This is a great shirt and I will be ordering more not that I know the fit and quality of fabric,1
Thanks,1
The size is not mentioned so until it arrive all you have is neck and arm length,2
Showing it is a 2x is far more descriptive to know if it will fit,0
I can only wear a 3X or larger,0
Nice material,1
Collar and sleeves fit exactly as expected,1
Body fits OK but could be a little roomier for me,0
"48"" chest, 44"" waist",0
"Not a lot of stretch, but a little",0
Size 17 neck 36/37 sleeve,0
"Soft, wrinkle resistant shirt that fit as required",1
I would recommend this product,1
I probably won't wear this too often because I don't see myself wearing a white dress shirt too often,0
When the next need arises I know this shirt will look good,1
It fit just as described and it looks great,1
You will not be disappointed,1
"Material is good thickness, not too thin like some shirts",1
Breathes ok,1
"this particular material holds hair, lint and dust pretty bad however",2
This is the only color that has done that out of the 4 or 5 shirts i bought from this group,0
The other colors have been ok,1
I bought this for my son,0
"The shirt is very nice quality, good fit and a great color",1
"The price was good, too",1
I would not hesitate to buy it again in another color for him,1
"This shirt is not well made or QC, it looks like they sew the QC label with washing label hence no QC the sewing machine treads on the collar are not uniform, a lot of treads hanging from the collars",2
This button down/dress shirt is very poor quality,2
My brother loves the shirt and it looks so great on him,1
Very well made and easy to wash and dry,1
Limited wrinkles which is awesome,1
Highly recommend,1
the collar does not flex as described,2
I have always got the shirts with expandable buttons but this is not the same,0
It fits ok but these are price point dress shirts for once in a while,0
Same shirts you can get at JC Penny,0
"Finding a black shirt for semi-casual wear seemed like a real task, but Amazon was there once again when the need arose",0
"Looks good, feels great and is much appreciated",1
"Husband needed a couple new work shirts, he found this one &amp",0
he loves the color &amp,1
it fits well,1
Exactly what he needed,1
"The collar on the shirt which was shipped was far too small for my neck, even though I ordered the collar that my neck measures at",2
"Perhaps if they had shipped the correct size shirt, I would be able to have a more favorable opinion",2
Had to iron this shirt so that was a disappointment,2
It food great and is comfortable,1
A different colored shirt that I got last year was made in Indonesia and it fit good,1
"I wanted to get another one in gray, but they were out last year",0
This year's shirt supply is made poorly in Ethiopia and didn't fit well,2
"The button holes and the buttons did not line up properly, so there was a bulge of extra fabric at the top below the collar",2
This is not acceptable,2
Good fit except too big on the arms,0
this white color is Flimsy than the other colored shirts i ordered otherwise still a good buy for the sale price,2
need a t shirt under this otherwise very nice shirt,0
we are pleased,1
These shirts were a great value for our groomsmen,1
They did layer with a solid white tee underneath but overall great fit,0
Very impressed with shirt,1
The fabric is soft and looks very dressy,1
My husband especially liked the collar,1
He said it was very comfortable,1
Just a tad on the large side but could not find a shirt to fit perfectly,0
"Great dress shirt, reasonable price",1
The fit was spot on w/ a little flex just in case,0
These shirts have no more give in the neck than any other dress shirt I_e worn in the past,0
That said the shirts fit fine and look nice,1
However if you want a little more stretch in the collar look elsewhere,2
Liked the color of shirt as pictured and fit extremely well--correct sizing as advertised,1
Nice shirt but the fabric is very thin,0
Thinner than previous purchase of the same,0
Except for that it is a nice shirt good quality,1
Very comfortable,1
Good Looking,1
Good Value for the money,1
Designer shirt for super cheap,1
Looks and fits,1
"This was a gift for my husband, he really liked the color and the fit",1
"These address nice shirts, but they still won't cover your big belly",0
They also do not come out of the dryer ready to wear,2
Perfect fit,1
Arrived early and seems _aylor fit,1
$55 retail price tag,0
Great deal _,1
"Would  buy again ,,,",1
Very happy,1
"The description stated DRESS SHIRT, LONG SLEEVE",0
It even stated the cuffs were adjustable,0
Guess what??? SHORT SLEEVE,0
Very disappointing,2
Who wears a short sleeve for dress? Honestly,0
__,0
not a comfortable material nor wrinkle free,2
Great looking shirt,1
My husband loves it,1
Nice shirt- fit as expected- bought the first one for $32,1

Beautiful shirt,1
Material is fabulous and feels great,1
Very nice shirt,1
Super happy about the purchase,1
"easy order and fast delivery,  shirt fits great",1
I would not recommend this shirt to any one absolutely trash,2
Fits to big when you tuck it and after one wash Material wears out,0
"Great fit, deep rich color",1
the shirt fit excellently,1
"However, it is a scientific breakthrough this company is able to produce a material as thin as this shirt",0
I was shocked at how see through this shirt was,0
"Excellent material, fits in all the right places",1
Look good,1
Nice shirt,1
Very good,1
This shirt fit fine it wasn't a tailored fit so it provided me with a nice fit that was comfortable,1
Less wrinkles if you hanger it damp and not put it in the drier,0
"Wore this in a wedding as a groomsmen, and it was perfect for the occasion",1
Nice,1
"Good quality shirt for an excellent price, could be a bit longer but it was good enough",1
I needed a shirt with longer sleeves and this one fit me well,1

The product is made qualitatively,1
My husband loves the shirt,1
The color was perfect for our son_ wedding,1
"It was fine for the money, but it's not awesome",0
"Good quality shirt, as advertised",1
You know for sure what you're getting from them,0
I'm very happy with these shirts,1
"I'm hard to fit, and the separate sizes for sleeve, neck and length make it much easier to find a shirt that fits everywhere",1
Nice comfortable fabric too,1
I'll probably order some more,1
It_ perfect,1
The color was just like the picture too,1
"Good price, better than Belk's price with discounts and coupons",1
I pulled this out of the bag and there was a stain,2
It almost looked like makeup,0
Really kind of gross,2
Probably will be returning it/finding a different seller,2
Contacting customer service now,0
Fits as expected,1
True to size,1
I like the size and fit of this shirt,1
Light weight and it stretches a bit,0
Husband loved the fit and color,1
Like,1
Looks and fits great,1
Yes good,1
It_ just ok,0
I was hoping for a little extra room around the neck,0
It_ about an inch too big,2
Nice shirt,1
But my necks not that big,0
Not as happy as I was in the 90's,0
"Excellent fit, excellent quality",1
Great value for an odd size,0
The collar does not stretch at all,2
This is false advertising and I am returning it,2
This shirt is so see through that you can see my son's skin and nipples through the fabric,2
Pretty much a waste of money as it will no be acceptable for an orchestra concert,2
"Great for, good fabric",1
I love this shirt,1
As expected,0

Shirt,0
I have ordered this shirt in every color in the dame size 18,0
36/37,0
However the reach in this shirt is nowhere close to being correct snd is about a 32 in reach,0
I am unsure if we received an irregular,0
Too short,2
Elegent shirt that's just the right size and smooth to the touch,1
Perfect for any job or just going out,1
Fits great _,1
"Looked nice, wrinkle badly and should be ironed to look good",0
The comfort and flexibility of the shirt amazing product,1
Ordered many shirts of the same size and sleeve length,0
The arm length varies greatly on each shirt,1
Mostly too short,2
Fit great,1
"A mi esposo le quedo muy bien, es comoda , fresca y elwgante",0
It was a great purchase,1
It fit perfectly and stretches in the shoulders which makes it more comfortable than my other dress shirts,1
Mi husband loves it,1
Item fit well but don't understand why you're showing it still in delivery,0
These shirts are my favorite,1
This dress shirts it's awesome and is very comfortable,1

This is a nice white shirt for dress or professional wear,1
"And it has a chest pocket, which is a feature that is rapidly disappearing in men_ shirts",0
"It does not have a placket down the front of the shirt where the buttonholes are located, which to us makes this shirt look a little more casual",0
The fit is _s expected,1
"My husband_ neck is between a 15 ¬Ω and a 16, and he found the size 15 ¬Ω a bit snug but wearable",0
"The fit is neither slim, nor baggy",0
"in other words, _egular is appropriate",0
The fabric is a bit lighter than the shirts my husband usually wears,0
He prefers a somewhat heavier fabric,0
I liked the weight of this one,1
Then comes the acid test: the laundering,0
"Coincidentally I washed this shirt with a white oxford-cloth dress shirt, a fabric that is my usual gold standard for wrinkle-free performance",0
The Van Heusen was ALMOST as wrinkle-free as the oxford cloth,0
"It would certainly be fine under a jacket and would do for regular office wear, but I think a touch-up ironing would be in order if the wearer wanted to make an especially good impression",0
Fit as expected in neck and sleeves,1
"I will add this caution to gentlemen out there who want to buy dress shirts online without trying them on, make sure to measure your neck and arms",0
"Especially if you have a shirt size in mind, but haven_ worn a dress shirt in a few years",0
"Or go to a department store and try some on, then come back to Amazon and save some money",0
Back to the shirt,0
"Very nice, high end look",1
"No shirt is truly wrinkle free, but this fabric once ironed should stay pretty crisp if you make sure to hang it when you_e done",0
The one thing I wasn_ quite sure on was the _tretch advertised,0
"I thought a stretch neck, or fabric with a little more give would be a great feature for a formal dress shirt, but I grabbed a handful of fabric and tugged, in both the neck and body of the shirt, there was no give at all",0
Just standard fabric,0
"Doesn_ detract at all from the quality or attractiveness of the shirt, just confused me a little because of the stretch advertised in the labeling",0
"Either way this is a very sharp shirt you can wear with a tie to dress it up, or a few buttons down without the tie, maybe even untucked if you wish",0
Still looks good either way,1
"It_ nice and light, as well as breathable which is something we can all appreciate when the temperature rises, or when you find yourself at a stuffy event",1
"Overall good fit, good packaging, hit it with an iron or steamer for a few minutes, toss on a tie and you_e ready to go",1
It will have you looking sharp in no time,0
"I was surprised to see this shirt was made in in Ethiopia, first time I ever had anything made there",0
The quality is standard Van Heusen,0
"I didn_ find anything particularly stretchy in the collar, it did have some give, but don_ expect it to stretch like women_ leggings",0
"I found the lighter patches along the tops of the shoulders a bit distracting, but the look is plainly evident in the listing pics  check out the pics of the models back",0
My 16,0
5 neck/34-35 sleeves were perfectly sized,0
"It_ a regular fit, but for me it fit close to that of a fitted shirt, this one was not at all boxy",0
"I wish they would stop using pins in the packaging, other than that the shirt did not disappoint",2
This is a great shirt,1
It's made with an ultra soft material that is lightweight and comfortable to wear on hot or cold days,1
It looks good with a suit and under a jacket as well,1
It washes well and only needs a light ironing,1
It's a vivid white and there are no flaws that I can find,1
4 stars,1
*If this review helped you make an informed choice about this product in any way I would appreciate it if you take a moment of your time and let me know by hitting the Helpful button and letting me know,0
"I appreciate that you took the time to read my review, Thank you",0
You can never have enough white shirts so I picked this one up for my husband,1
He_ 5,0
10 and about 210 lbs the fit is perfect on him,0
It is on the thinner side and needed  a t shirt underneath but other than that it_ a nicely made shirt with good quality,0
He looks so handsome in it with his black suit on,1
"I washed it on the delicate cycle, and low setting for the dryer took it out as soon as it done and no ironing was needed",0
I'm always excited to try out a new Van Heusen,1
"This regular fit is indeed regular - not too athletic anywhere and can handle a little bit of ""gut""",0
"Finishes, seams, touch and feel, color - all up to par with this brands track record - good plus",0
I don't really notice the stretch collar feature unless I try stretching it by hand - but it certainly doesn't hurt,0
I got the 32''-33'' sleeve - a little short for me at 6' tall,0
This shirt handled the first round of laundry perfectly,0
Strong buy recommendation,1
For $20,0
at time of review,0
", this is a really nice dress shirt",1
The color is saturated and the material is comfortable and nice without looking cheap,1
Fit as expected,1
Perfect work or church staple,1
The flex fit is more comfortable for my husband than the more structured shirts,0
"Would recommend, especially for the price",1
"In my experience, this brand holds up to washing really well",1
This is the size my husband wears in dress shirts and this shirt matched his body type to the T,0
5 8 165,0
It wasn_ too loose or too tight,0
The stitching around the cuffs and buttons were well stitched,1
The material is soft almost silky in texture,1
The collar  and color is just as advertised in the picture,1
These are excellent modern versions of a classic men's dress shirt,1
"Sizing is as expected, which is of course par for the course for a venerable brand like Van Heusen",1
Flex feature improves comfort,1
"Can be washed and cared for at home, but looks best when professionally cleaned and pressed",1
"Van Heusen makes a good shirt, and I've owned them and Arrow for many years",1
"This shirt is a continuation of the line, well made, good value, comfortable, full cut",1
"It's nice enough to wear with a suit, or for a more casual look without a tie",1
"You get classic looks, quality and price",1
A good value,1
Other shirts I've bought have shrunk when dry cleaned making them very difficult to button the top button to wear a tie,0
So far these shirts have not shrunken significantly,0
Hope that continues,0
My only issue with this shirt is the material it's made of,2
I just don't like this stretchy blend of cotton and polyester,2
It's thin and doesn't feel natural,2
I would pick a 100% cotton shirt over this one any day,0
Great shirt with comfortable and perfect fit,1
Great material that looks amazing,1
I don_ own many dress shirts and though this was free I now want to go purchase more options,0
"This shirt feels to be of the cheapest material, and does not feel at all like ""stretch"" material",2
The shirt is also SEE THROUGH in white,0
"Meaning, you can actually see your skin through it",0
Not a quality dress shirt,2
"Fits as expected, workmanship seems to be good",1
"Material is good, smooth and not flimsy",1
Buttons are tight,2
Great quality comfortable material with a stretchy neck,1
It fit as expected and I found no visible defects,1
"Fit like it was made for me, true to size",1
The packaging was very nice,1
I would highly recommend,1
"The dress shirt is good, especially for the price",1
The only thing is that the material its very thin,0
Bought this for my husband,0
It fits well and he likes that the neck expands just a little making wearing a tie more comfortable,1
As pictured,1
"the shirt that showed was mislabeled, was way to small",2
Shirt arrived open and had been either tried on or worn,2
Can_ believe it was such a mess,2
"Very comfortable, good finish",1
Fits very nice,1
I have ordered 2 Blue frost shirts and both had different flaws,2
The first one the top button was not aligned properly and the second one the cuffs was cut way to small,2
I wear Van Heusen shirts all the time specifically this style and i have never had any issues like this,2
The fabric just didnt seem right to me either,2
I question the sellers product legitimacy,2
Purchased for my husband to wear to work at a large box store,0
He has wide shoulders and long arms and he said the future was perfect and the shirts give him great range of motion for work and they are very comfortable,1
Very nice shirt,1
Very comfortable,1
Very stylish,1
"The color is nice, totally subjective I know but I like it, fit and finish are very good",1
"It appears so be fairly sturdy, I like to roll my sleeves up to the elbow and every now and then my bony elbows will rip the sleeve open if it doesn't ride up when I bend my arm",0
With this Van Heusen Dress shirt so far so good,1
"Each time I've worn this one, recently, we've had 90 degree plus days, yet I don't feel uncomfortable wear and working in, it is not sticking too me unlike some shirts",1
"The collar is a good fit for me, that is a big deal for me as it is hard to find a shirt that has long enough arms, a good chest size and not too tight or too loose in the neck",1
Most off the shelf shirts that fit elsewhere try to strangle me or make me look as though I have lost too much weight too quickly,0
"Bottom line, I like this shirt",1
It is amazing how much a little stretch material in a dress shirt to make it much more comfortable,1
"I found that the cut of the shirt was perfect, it has a tailored fit",1
But still enough room in the collar,0
"I_ 5 6, 165 and wearing a size 15",0
I also like how it is styled,1
"Clean white, fabric doesn_ seem to hold stains, and the collar lays nicely",1
this shirt is awesome,1
the money I well spent the quality amazing  it feels very comfortable it moves with you the flex material great I'm ordering another shirt right at this moment thank you,1

I purchased this as a gift and he loved it,1
It fit perfectly and true to size,1
"Good quality he said, so I am happy if he is happy",1
I was sceptical about getting the shirts but now I have three we really like them,1
