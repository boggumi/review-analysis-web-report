sentence,sentiment
"It's a pretty good, inexpensive casual or business casual shirt",1
"For example, it has no side pleats in back and doesn't have a box pleat below the yoke",0
If you do you'll be disappointed,2
This is only noticeable to me and only because I seem to have a habit of messing with them,0
"Also, there are lots of loose threads from production that aren't removed so be ready to give the shirt a quick going over when you get it",2
Not a big deal,0
Overall a solid shirt,1
pardon the pun,0
and a great standby for any traditional guy's closet,1
This is one of Van Heusen's better quality made shirts,1
"Although not completely iron free, if you wash and dry with a small load and remove from the dryer and hang immediately you won't require much ironing, none at all for those that wear these as casual shirts",0
I iron everything I wear,0
These are very well made shirts,1
Not thin or see through,0
"They look great with a sport coat and jeans, or as a dress shirt",1
For the price $22,0
"00, you simply can't beat these shirts",1
The colors are vivid,1
It's hard finding Striped Oxford shirts without paying at least $50,1
00 a pop or more,0
These are well worth every cent,1
I'd order more if they had more colors,1
Sizes are true in American sizing,0
So order your regular size without worrying about China's sizing,0
Great shirts,1
I have ordered quite a few of these shirts the past year,0
"So, I guess that the odds of me receiving one that was flawed was bound to happen",2
The issue is that I bought this shirt the end of February as a gift for my son in law,0
He did not wear the shirt right away because he was asked to work from home due to Covid19 the past ten weeks,0
Recently he wore the shirt and then washed it only to discover the unfinished seems at the cuff of each arm,0
It is past the time frame for me to return the shirt to the vender nor am I able to attempt the return,2
I would exchange this shirt if I could,2
Its disappointing,2
Darn Covid19,0
I have had a difficult time finding shirts that fit just right and are well constructed,1
I usually like Van Heusen and these shirts are no different,0
"The fit is great, neck size is good and sleeve length is great",1
"The material is a little on the heavy side, in a good way and all of the stitching feels durable",1
I originally bought one shirt to test it out,0
I have since bought two more in other colors so I can add them to my regular rotation,0
For the price I think these are fantastic,1
"I?셫 6???? 180lbs, fit",0
I purchased the blue 16,0
"5, 34/35 which fits me well, which includes the sleeve length",0

RECOMMENDATION:,0
"Not the best shirt out there, the fabric feels so rough, it does not feel high quality",2
I don?셳 recommend it,2
I bought two shirts as a backup for when they would be needed for work,1
I wore the blue striped shirt twice,0
It's only been washed once,0
"The second time I wore it, I felt it split 3"" on the left side by the seem",0
It's a good looking and comfortable shirt,1
I just won't buy them again,2
I can't contact the buyer and return it because it's over a month since being bought,2
So much for planning ahead and having shirts ready when needed,0
I'm more a jeans and flannel shirt guy,0
I don't think I'll be embarrassing the family or myself,0
I also bought a light blue Van Heusen shirt for the alternate night,0
"Now, I just need to find a tie",0
"I needed a semi-dressy oxford cloth shirt that I could wear with a tie to church on Sunday, as well as without a tie for general ""business casual"" use",0
"I have had good luck with this brand in the past, and with Amazon's guarantees and ability to return if unsatisfied, I decided to give it a try",1
This is a VERY nice shirt,1
"Irons up very well, and it's well constructed to take a tie-- or NO tie",1
I liked this shirt so much that after a month I just ordered a second one,1
Another quality Van Heusen dress shirt for my 'collection',1
"The collection starts at 16"" then 16",0
"5, then 17, then 17",0
"5, so I skipped 18 for this 18",0
They're too small to wear and too good to get rid of,2
I keep thinking one of these years I'll lose some weight,0
"These shirts are great, fit well",1
not too loose not too tight,0
and the best part is the sleeves really are 36-37,0
I always tell people I have monkey arms and it's so hard to get sleeves that are the correct size without getting Tall,0
not as common as it should be,0
or 2 XL which are then like wearing a tent,0
"These are perfect, just wish they were in a few more colors other than shades of blue",1
The fabric literally shredded,2
Extremely poor construction,2
I should have realized it when threads wear coming off both sleeves the first time I wore it,2
I have added 3 pic's to show the shady workmanship,0
Buyer BEWARE,2
I purchased two of these shirts and they wrinkle pretty bad compared to other shirts these days,2
I take them out of the dryer before it stops and hang them,0
"Nice material, good fit, nice style and such",1
just the wrinkling is my problem,0
And I am not expecting them to be wearable out of the dryer,2
I bought four of these shirts in different colors,0
They are fabulous,1
"The material seems high quality, they look great, and fit perfectly",1
"I'm on the small side, and trying to get dress shirts, much less sharp-looking dress shirts that fit is increasingly difficult",2
Ant to get these shirts at this price is near-unimaginable,1
Definitely runs small,2
I wouldn't recommend,2
I?셫 fairly gentle with my clothes and I?셶e never had anything like this happen before,0
"After first wash, cuffs became horribly frayed and mangled at the edges - had to end up cutting off several loose and frayed threads from both cuffs",2
"For the record, care instructions say machine wash is fine",0
Very pleased with look and feel,1
I wear a 15 1/2  32-33,0
Nice garment,1
I couldn?셳 wait to wear after its arrival,0
Staff that was assigned to ?쐁lean it??did a lousy job,0
Got a beautiful shirt  after that little trimming,0
The shirt is very nice,1
"Comfortable, fits well and  does not wrinkle",1
I ordered 34/35 sleeve length and it is the longest sleeve I?셶e ever owned,0
Have to roll up and cuff to wear otherwise I look like a pirate with billowing sleeves,0
Actual measurement is closer to 37,0
Useless as a work/office dress shirt unless you are Captain Jack Sparrow,2
Good fit at the neck/chest area,1
Especially considering the casual nature of the shirt,0
Van Heusen is consistently dependable,0
This shirt was what I was looking for,1
"It is dressy enough to wear with a tie and jacket, yet it also goes well with jeans",0
I definitely recommend it,1
Junk and paper thin shirt,2
I had to return two shirts as they had not been sewn at the edges of the sleeve cuff leaving a raw open fabric edge,2
Never buy again,2
The shirt comes out of the dryer looking pretty good,1
The seams are straight and the fit is good,1
The seams on both sleeve cuffs came un-stitched with first laundering,2
The shirt is unusable,2
Update: Shirt replaced quickly with easy return of the original,0
"If this one holds up, I will update rating to 5 stars",0
"Very nice color, excellent fit",1
Good wearability and thank god it comes in many sizes,1
"I get compliments wearing these Van Heusen shirts, mainly because they fit",1
"Plus, THEY LOOK GREAT, and the collars are very sturdy and clean-looking",0
I love the way these fit,1
"My husband wore this shirt twice?봶ashed on cold gentle cycle, delicate dryer as all his work shirts are",0
The cuffs have completely fallen apart on both sleeves,2
Not just the stitching either?봳he fabric itself has literally shredded,2
Extremely poor construction,2
"This shirt is really nice looking, well made and wrinkle-free",1
"Really, wrinkle-free",1
So why doesn't Van Heusen make more like this? I don't know,1
I certainly would buy a few more in solid colors,1
"Now other Van Heusen shirts? Trashy, not wrinkle-free, not true to size and cheap looking although the same price",0
Go figure,1
Bought this for my husband to wear to our son?셲 rehearsal dinner,0
It looked very good with black dress pants and a tie,1
"The shirt is made out of a very nice material, very easy to press",1
"These fit as expected since you order by neck and sleeve size, it makes no sense to buy ones that are just s, m, lg, xl and expect a good fit",0
I noticed some threads loose on the left shoulder when I wore it the first time,2
I thought they were just loose threads that could be cut,2
Wore it a second time and went to cut the threads they are coming out in several places,2
Very dissapointed,2
This shirt waste of money,2
I can?셳 recommend this shirt even though I have always had good luck with Van Heiden,1
Overall it was good,1
Not easy care or wrinkle free,2
Disappointed,2
My husband wore out his Van Heusen dress shirt - he liked the look and fit that much,1
"So glad we were able to order a new one online during our state's ""Stay At Home"" order",1
This shirt is great,1
Just as advertised and I am happy as I didn't have to wait in a line,1
"In fact, I'm ordering more",1
"I was happy to find the size, quality, and color needed",1
I bought this shirt for my husband to wear to semi-dressy events,0
It fits well and I am happy,1
"got this for my husband and it fit true to size, and it was half the price from big name stores, which is even better",1
And it fit as we expected it too,1
And the color looks good on him,1
No complaints,0
Really like the shirt,1
It is a little snug through the chest and waist,0
These seem to run a bit smaller than my other brand dress shirts of the same size,0
Van Huesen had the best dress shoes,1
"great fabric, feel and amazing well made",1
My Husbands fave' ~ look great on him,1
PJ,0
I ordered this shirt because I have one just like it -exactly the same,1
Older one is 5 years old and still like new,0
Was replacing some others from other manufacturers with same stripe as collars started to wear from chin whiskers,0
"Oh, I do have many other shirts for all seasons blue pin striped are my casual favorites",2
"An inexpensive shirt, and you get what you pay for",1
"The fit is a little blousy, and the fabric a bit thin",0
"Still, the price was right",0
Husband wears these types of shirts to work,0
He likes them for their comfort,1
I like them because they don?셳 need ironing,1
Defective stitching on pocket,2
See photo,0
Returning shirt,0
A little larger than I thought it would fit,0
Other than that it is a nice shirt,1
I received a lot of shirts at the same time and tried them on,0
Its not a heavy dress shirt,0
More light then heavy,0
happy with it,1
Better then expected for the price,1
"They are good looking, wrinkle resistant shirts",1
Unfortunately i didn't try the shirt one right after i purchased it,0
This was a back up and its been way over a month since my purchase,2
When i put it on for the first time the sleeves and cuffs were too small,2
"Make sure you try it on the same day you get it , even if it is a backup",0
Wrinkles bad,2
This one comes out immediately from the dryer and requires it to be ironed,0
Not good,2
"Arrived on time, and they are a perfect fit for a paunchy old guy with a 17 1/2 inch neck size",1
I must say that I was pleasantly pleased with these purchases,1
Bought five at same size  and I am just please at the fit especially in neck and sleeves,1
Tailoring is nat bad either,0
It appears shirt manufactures are saving on material,2
tight in all the wrong places,2
Love it,1
Will buy another,1
A true taylored shirt,0
Beautiful shirt,2

Purchased this shirt for my husband and it?셲 a great quality shirt,1
I ordered a couple of these shirts online because I could not find my exact size locally,0
16 x 34/35,0
The fit is pretty good,1
Just on the loose side,0
a tad,0
The fabric is not super heavy,0
I like the weight,1
"Overall, happy with the shirt",1
Basic dress shirt without all the frills,0
"This was exactly to fit, I wear it for work",0
I love it,1
Great material and doesn't shrink or fade after a few washes,1
"I wore this shirt 1 time, then I washed it and both cuff sleeves have completely fallen apart",2
The fabric literally shredded,2
Extremely poor quality,2
Please stay away from this,1
Waste of ?뮥,2
Great quality,1
Shirt was a perfect fit,1
Wore to compliment my wife?셲 dress for a night out event,1
"Of course, I noticed this after the return date, so now face an expensive repair",2
Beware,0
"The quality and design of this dress shirt is extraordinary, especially given the cost",2
"Well done, Van Heusen",1
Seems very well made and fit exactly like it should,1
pretty  - nice material  fast shipping and well packed,1
This is a really nice looking shirt,1
Which I used to dress up,0
The shirt fit fine,1
My problem is the cuffs unraveled on the first time my husband wore it,2
Unfortunately it was past the date of making a return,2
Poor quality in sewing appears to be the cause,2
The seam did not fix the fabric it was supposed to hold,2
What a waste of money,2
Very nice shirt,1
Well made and very comfortable,1
An exceptionally competent shirt at a fair price,1
La mejor opci처n en camisas lindas y de f찼cil planchado es VAN HAUSEN,0

Quality shirt,1
Only issue was LOTS of loose threads,2

Not long enough,0
Wish to return,2
Please advise,0
Nice quality,1
Fits great,1

Shirt was as described by seller,0
A few loose threads that had not been cut off which is not unusual for a shirt in this price range,2

Fits just right,1
Will probably buy more in other colors and patterns,1
Well-made shirt,1
Feels and looks like an expensive dress shirt,1
Took correct measurements of myself and it fit great,0
The fit was not at all as I expected,2
The sleeves were way too long and the shirt was very baggy all around,2
So I ordered a different size and it fit very  well,0
This shirt was bought to replace the same shirt bought 20 years ago,0
Looks and feels to be the same product,1
We'll let you know if this one lasts 20 years,0
Van  Heusen is a great brand,1
The fit is exactly right,1
Barely tucks in my pants,0
Love the shirt,1
I wish I could get some others in different patterns in my size,1
Good quality and one of the few items where I ordered what I normally wear and it came in just right,1

Same professional dry cleaners I?셶e used for decades and not had this happen to any other dress shirt or garment,2

"I really love this shirt its fit perfectly, it is just perfect for me",1
Thanks a lot,0
"I like design,color,brandname",1
"Beautiful shirt, great colors, fits very well and the price is very good",1
"Van Huesen shirts have been around for a long time, there's a good reason",1
The feel of the fabric and the fit is not as expected,0
"With only wearing this a few times, the shirt should not have lose threads",2
:-,0
Fits great,1
Just what I needed,1
I ordered 18,0

"Good feel, soft material, easy to iron and looks sharp",1

Poor stitching quality,2
My wife is working on stitching up the cuffs,2
size was exactly correct,0
shirt fits fine,1
"The blue stripes are quite clear, soft blue",1
Really did not like the way this fit,2
Much to big,2

Great quality and look though,1
I love the shirt,1
It is comfortable and looks great with navy slacks,1
"I live in South Georgia, so it's definitely not a summer shirt",0
It fits as expected,0
Nice,1
"If you are on-the-fence between sleeve length options, go with the longer sleeve",0
"Otherwise, fits well and looks good",1
Quality is not so good and strands of thread are coming out on many places of the shirt,2
It is not really easy care,2
It definitely needs ironing after washing and drying,2
I don?셳 consider that easy care,0
"Great shirt, great price, bought a second shirt",1
These are a great value,1
You could easily pay two or three times as much for a shirt of this quality,1
I am wearing one right now,0
Spend a bit more and get a good fit at others,2
"The Van Heusen  brand has obviously gone the way of what once were 1st class producers such as Bell and Howell, Arrow, etc",1
good product,1
I wore this shirt three times and the sleeve stitching completely unraveled,2
Poor quality,2
Good,1
"I have always like Van Heusen shirts, and have been buying them for many years",0
This particular shirt was on sale and probably because  it has issues,2

Unless you are obese better to get slim fit,0
The headline is the review:,0
"Good quality, good fit, good appearance, good price, delivered promptly",1
Will buy more as the occasion merits,1
First of all they have different size criteria and had to actually have my brother measure his neck size,1
"After measuring it well, and choosing the closest size from this list, this is way too large to fit in",0
Satisfied customer,1
Decent shirt for the price,1
Fits just like every other shirt I own with the same measurements,0

Good quality for casual Fridays,1
I like the way it fits and I like the way it looks,1
Received great compliments from friends,1
SHIRTS RUN VERY SMALL-IF YOUR SELECTING 15 OR 16 NECK GO ONE UP IN SIZE,0
Perfect as I want,1
Van Heusen shirts just seem to fit great and look great,1
It's a well made shirt and I'm glad i got it for a very good price,1
Great quality and stripes spacing and color suttle yet dressy,1
"Very well made, washes and wears well",1
"I've never had any problems with Van Heusen shirts, my favorite",1
"I opened one shirt-it is paper thin, very poor quality and about two sizes too small",2
What happened to Van Heusen?  I bought four of these and wasted my money,2
"The boxes were left out in pouring rain, instead of putting under the covered porch, so returning is not even possible",0
"love these shirts, excellent quatlity for the price",1
Great shirt at a great price,1
Good looking,1
durable I would guess,1
Van Heusen shirts are very consistent over past 30 years,1
Very good quality and fit,1
I always consider these when looking for dress shirts,0

This was a gift and he loved it,1
A decent shirt for the money,0
Seems like a poor sewing job,2
Don?셳 waste your money,2
Bought this shirt for my husband and the cuffs frayed after the first wash,0
Returned it and got a replacement,2
Washed that one and the same thing happened even before wearing,0
Poor quality,2
"The shirt arrived bunched up in an envelope, torn",0
"The size 18 neck, 33/34 sleeve made it a Big and Tall, so had too much volume around the middle that I didn't need",0
Returned it for full credit from Amazon,0
Great,1
This shirt is exactly as pictured,0
It was true to size and is classic fit shirt,1

It fit well and quickly became one of my favorites for work and play,1
"Good quality, looks good and fit as expected",1
Well tailored and nice material,1
Coler was different than anything I had and very versitle,1
Nice pinpoint color,1
I washed it on the delicate setting with some of my other work shirts and both cuffs separated,2
Unwearable,2
This item is complete garbage,2
My husband wore this shirt one time and the material on the inside of the neck is coming unstitched,2
"Shirt is well made, and very comfortable",1
"The shirt fits perfectly, and is beautiful",1
The shirt was sewn with parts of the shirt's material on the wrong side,2
This is a very basic part of sewing to sew the garment with the material facing the same side,0
Good price,1
Nice shirt,1
I love the quality of this brand,1
As expected,0
Good product,1

He looks so handsome in this and I think it's one of his new favorites,1
An overall great buy,1

It was used for work and church,0
I have been wearing these shirts for years at work each day,0
"Very good quality, fits well, very comfortable, wrinkle free, once dried, just fold them well and press them in the pile of clothing and they come out neat looking",1
I strongly recommand,1
I am very pleased with all 3 Van Heisenberg Dress shirts,1
They fit perfectly and I could not,1

Love this bread,1
This is not typical of Van Heusen shirts,0
Colors ran when sent the first time to the dry cleaners,2
Send 5 shirts weekly and have never had this happen,0

Very nice shirt,1
I ordered the same size as always 17' neck / 33' sleeve,0

Nice made shirt though,1
I can wear it open collar with sport jacket,0
Great colour and fit,1
These shirts are very good and fit well,1
It is pretty sad that there are so few manufacturers who sell their shirts the old way: by neck size and sleeve length,2
Unfortunately we are not a S/M/L/XL society,0
Great purchase,1
"I'm 6'0, 195 and this shirt fits great even at 180",0
I've bought them for years at the outlet mall,0
when this particular size and color is in,0
They're a no brainer and I wear them to work,0
Looks great on my son,1
"Nice shirt, fit well",1
great,1
GOOD,1
Even taking it out of the dryer it is not wearable without ironing,2
I will send it to the commercial laundry from now on,2
"So, I took a chance and ordered a 16 33-34 and it fit like a 15 1/2  Van Heusen is hit and miss that way sometimes",0
"Overall, its a decent shirt",1
Great looking Oxford Cloth dress shirt,1
like I used to wear 50+ years ago,0
Great fit and dignified simplicity for any well dressed man,1
Tall men need the extra arm length and this shirt provides,1
Sorry that this shirt is 65% polyester - 35% cotton,0
It is a hot shirt in the summer,0
Shirt looks exactly like the picture and fits well,1
We have not had problems with wrinkles after several washings and the shirt is as vibrant as the day we bought it,1
"I am 6'1"", 255lbs",0
I re-ordered 16-16,0
"5, 36/37 and they fit great",0
I find that IZOD generally fits comfortably for bigger guys,0
like myself,0
I have not washed or had the shirt pressed yet,0
I washed this shirt for the first time and it was not wrinkle free,0
Am very disappointed that this shirt does not hang up wrinkly free,2
Shirt looks good and at a better price then in stores,1
Very good,1
Stitching on one of the sleeves was irregular with lots of threads hanging out,2
Otherwise a great shirt,1
I always like to wear this kind of model  shirt,0
I feel very confortable and good looking when I used it,1
"This shirt is too large, I bought the smallest size and it looks like a XL",2
Too small and too tight based on other Van Heusen men's dress shirts that I have bought,2
great shirt fit right wrinkle free tough durable shirt would buy it again,1
Always depend on a perfect fit with Van Heusen,1
Great shirt,1

Good,1
The shirt is too large for me and I give it to my father,2
And it fits,1
I purchased 2 Van Husen striped shirts from a department store and like most consumers reported,0
"After the first wash, the thread on the chest line began to come lose",2
"Now, it looks like the shirted has the stressed look",2
Not a Good look in Executive meetings,2
"My other shirt threads came out on the size, and the material simply tore",2
I think Van Husen is officially off my purchase list,2
I ordered 3 of these shirts as they were on sale,0
Unfortunately I made the mistake of not washing just one to see what it looked like,2
They all look wrinkled no matter how you wash and dry them,2
Even my wife who is not that picky says they always look wrinkled,2
My advice is to buy a shirt from LL Bean and then one of these,2
I can guarantee that you will want to send this one back,2
"If you want a shirt to leave untucked with jeans on casual day at work, yes you can get away with one of these",0
I gave them 2 stars because I've seen worse,2
larger neck,2
"This is a nice shirt, pretty much just what I was looking for",1
My only suggestion is they be a little more precise on sleeve lengths,2
"An inch makes a difference so I would prefer a 34"" sleeve over a 35"" sleeve and over a 34/35"" sleeve",2
I like the shirt,1
"It fits perfectly, it's well tailored and made",1
"Other than that, I like it very much",1
"I bought it for my husband, and he loved it",1
This shirt is excellent as I expected,1
"The fit was just right, the material and price were excellent and I am completely satisfied",1
I'd like more of this in different colors,1
Sleeves too short,2
"Decent material, not great",0
When I washed the shirt the cuffs on the shirt fell apart,2
Bough this for my fiance,0
"He liked it very much in fit, feel, and color",1
Both cuffs in the shirt came apart with the first washing,0
The quality is horrible,2
Great quality just a little loose for my style,1
Slim fit would be perfect,1
Shirt sleeves are different lengths,2
I gave this to my father in law as a gift for Christmas and he just opened it,0
Apparently too late to return it deadline was 01/31 and it is now 02/04 - so now he is stuck with a useless shirt,2
very disappointing,2
"I haven't worn these business shirts much, so here's the main point: after being tailor measured, Van Heusen fit better than a competitor",2
for this exact shirt style,0
Which is how I found a problem with fit from a competitor shirt maker,0
"I bought this shirt recently after receiving 2 other shirts in different colors for Christmas, to replace 3 other long sleeve shirts that are past their prime which I gave away to be used as art smocks",0
Very happy with the shirt I purchased plus,1
the two that were Christmas gifts,0
Quality shirt that had a comfortable feel and eye appealing look,1
Loved the color selection and felt the measurement guidance was helpful,1
The size I selected perfectly fit my build,1
I wear a 16,0
"5 36/37 and the shirt was a perfect fit, nice quality",1
Will buy additional colors,1
I husband loved this shirt,1
"It fit as expected, and at a good price",1
"Excellent material, good looking - and truly wrinkle-free",1
"Great, great value",1
Great shirt,1
like it a lot,1
"Great material, worth the price",1
Nice shirt,1
Me agrado fino,0
"Ok, so I'm short and stocky",2
let's get that out the way,2
These 18 1/2 x 32 shirts really fit me well,1
Love the way they feel and I wish they had all colors in stock so I could buy them all in my size,1
Comfortable fit and reasonable delivery,1
"This product looks fine and fits fine, althought the material is very thin",0
four or five wearings?,0
", the cuff completely opened up at the end",2
I can't see any signs of threads in there and it looks like a lot of the seams are just glued,2
"Oh well, the price was right",1
If my $200 shirts last 4 years maybe it's right that a $25 shirt lasts 4 months,0
I like this shirt,1
It has sleeves that are long enough for me,2
I wanted something in red because I already had enough blue shirts,0
It was exactly what I wanted,1
"It seems well-made, and should last a few years",1
I can now throw out or donate some other shirts that do not fit well or are worn out,2
"I got this shirt rolled up in a bag without any tags, pins etc",0
This is a great looking shirt &amp,1
the size was dead on,0
I wash it with other whites &amp,0
when done hang it on a plastic hanger to almost air dry,0
I then put it in the dryer with a dryer sheet on medium setting for about 10 minutes &amp,0
it comes out dry &amp,0
without wrinkles,0
This shirt fits well is and is as expected as far as quality from Van Heusen,1
I have had many Van Heusen shirts over the years and this one was the same as all others,0
"good quality, good fit ans the sleeves are the length they say they are",1
I will definitely be buying other shirts like this on Amazon,2
"A partir de cierta talla deber챠a ser obvio que no soy delgado, nunca dijeron que fuera corte Slim",0
"Muy mal, no la regres챕 porque prefiero regalarla que seguir perdiendo el tiempo",0
I purchased this shirt and as I always do I wash it before use,0
When I went iron it I noticed a cut in the breast pocket that can?셳 be repaired,2
This was a defect in the shirt not caused by the washer,2
I have ordered many Van Heusen shirts in the past and no issue,0
"The shirt is very good as far as quality is concerned, I love the color",1
"As far as the size is concerned, I noticed that at the reverse of the wrapping plastic bag, there are three more additional sizes: Regular, Slim and Fitted",0
I do not understand why these additional sizes are not included in the on line description,2
"I could have had the option to decide what size would have been more addecuate to me, of course the regular fit is not the proper one",0
"La grande vari챕t챕 de ce mod챔le, sa disponibilit챕 en format pour moi, grandeur  cou et manches",0

This shirts fits comfortably and the price was right,1
Very good quality for the price,1
"Muy tersa y suave la tela, buena calidad, muy buen producto",0
En cuanto a la talla ya ten챠a otros productos de la marca y las medidas se mantienen uniformes,0
Quality is absolutely garbage,2
Wore the shirt and washed it four times and the cuffs are falling apart,2
Even when I received it brand new I looked at the quality and knew it wouldn't last long,2
Waste of money,2
Very good value,1
Highly recommended,1

Fit perfect,1
This is basically a good shirt,1
"Most of my shirts are Van Huesen, and I appreciate them",1
It had labels on it declaring that it was a Flex collar,0
"I have some Van Huesen shirts with flex flex collars, that have a built-in extendable collaf",0
They are good,1
This one did not stretch,2
Otherwise a good shirt,1
I think the supervisor of the guy over in Bangladesh,0
country of origin,0
"told him to put 275 of the ""FLEX COLLAR"" tags on by lunch time, and the worker, perhaps not being literate, worked hard to get them all affixed",1
This shirt replaced a similar Joseph Fees brand dress shirt,0
wear with no worries,1
"I wore this shirt to a job interview, and next thing I know I've moved 2000 miles and I'm making more money than I ever have",1
This is the very first product review that I have ever written and I am 77 years old,0
"I bought two shirts, one white and one blue and they were delivered separately",0
The white one was in original packaging and was perfect,1
apparently by another supplier,0
The blue shirt is the issue,2
It was delivered in a loose package and it looked like someone had been sleeping in it for a week,2
It was completely wrinkled and out of its original packaging,2
The sleeves are supposed to be 36-37 inches,2
Not even close,2
Plus the left sleeve is about 2 inches shorter than the right sleeve,2
Not a good shirt,2
I returned the other shirt and will keep this because I need a dress shirt for a wedding,0
"I have always liked Van Heusen shirts,",1
"As they fit well, look good too",1

I highly recommend the quality though,1
"Fits perfect, color and texture is great",1
"Is cut nicely, too",1
"For $22, I'd buy this shirt regularly",1
This is a decent shirt,1
Pros:,1
The neck fit is nice with a little stretch,1
Wrinkle free is great,1
Cons:,2
The shirt came with a small black spot on it that doesn't seem to come out in the wash,2
"By ""regular fit"" they mean huge",0
Like really HUGE,0
"If you are not large person you should look for a ""slim fit"" or ""skinny fit""",0
"This is more of a ""regal fit"" in my opinion",0
The flex neck is very comfortable,1
The shirt fits true to size,1
I could probably use more of a tapered fit,0
I_ not a slim fit,0
I ordered 4 shirts,0
I will order more like this if I can find other colors in my size,1
Please note: the first two I ordered from Macy_ were a nightmare,2
When they arrived,0
"the white one had two different size sleeves, as well as different style sleeves",0
I wrote a negative review on Macy_ site and returned it to Macy_ in person,2
The salesperson didn_ ask any questions and didn_ care when I told him the issue,2
I did not want them to resell the shirt,2
"18 neck, 32-33 sleeves",0
"So, I ordered 2 more through Amazon",0
It was scrunched up in a ball and stuffed in a plastic bag,2
I planned on washing/ironing them first anyway and was thankful they fit and had matching,1
correct,1
style sleeves,0
The issue I think was Christmas time shopping over loud  and I believe Van Heusen is going out of business,2
"The neck is to large, I measured against some other shirts I have and it is over an inch bigger",2
It is not a stretch neck as advertised,2
"The sleeves are short, they are 2 to 3 inches shorter than my other shirts with the same sleeve length",2
Don't buy this shirt,2
Very comfortable with a nice fit,1
"The colors are bright and bold, which are perfect for me as an elementary teacher",1
"The only negative I've found is that Purple Haze is awfully close to Hearth, which I had ordered previously",2
I believe the camera flash has left it looking a bit brighter in the demo photo above than it actually appears in real life,0
"I was somewhat disappointed when I put it in my closet and noticed that they were very close shades of one another, with Hearth just having a tinge more red than Purple Haze",2
Looks great,1
packaged well,1
I can't imagine my neck went up 2 sizes so I wouldn't really take the stretch part to the bank,0
If you think you need a specific size get that or maybe 1/2 bigger,0
The shirt is the same cut as the shirts I_e bought from the brick and mirror store,0
"I included a picture of what it looks like compared to my husbands actual pink and purple shirts and as you can tell, it_ light purple",0
"It_ fine, I_l keep the shirt, it_ just annoying since I was trying to replace a pink shirt",2
"In a dress shirt, it's all about the collar",0
"Fabric or prints are always overshadowed by either a sad, weak collar that won't standup or like this shirt, a stiff, vertical collar that stands up to a distinctive profile",0
Plenty of room in my 44 inch mid section and 50 inch chest,0
Great fit,1
"Compre una camisa Van Heusen, recib챠 algo que no tiene marca no se exactamente que talla es, no es el producto que solicite, decepcionado de la compra pero sobre todo decepcionado de Amazon de no validar la calidad de los productos que ofrecen",0
I_e never had a problem with the other van Huesen shirts I_e bought on amazon,0
Over the years I have had difficulty finding a dress or sport shirt that fits me,0
"I have short, strong arms, a full, strong torso, and full muscular, short neck",0
This is a great shirt and I will be ordering more not that I know the fit and quality of fabric,1
Thanks,1
The size is not mentioned so until it arrive all you have is neck and arm length,2
Showing it is a 2x is far more descriptive to know if it will fit,0
I can only wear a 3X or larger,0
Nice material,1
Collar and sleeves fit exactly as expected,1
"48"" chest, 44"" waist",0
Size 17 neck 36/37 sleeve,0
"Soft, wrinkle resistant shirt that fit as required",1
I would recommend this product,1
I probably won't wear this too often because I don't see myself wearing a white dress shirt too often,0
When the next need arises I know this shirt will look good,1
It fit just as described and it looks great,1
You will not be disappointed,1
"Material is good thickness, not too thin like some shirts",1
Breathes ok,1
This is the only color that has done that out of the 4 or 5 shirts i bought from this group,0
The other colors have been ok,1
I bought this for my son,0
"The shirt is very nice quality, good fit and a great color",1
"The price was good, too",1
I would not hesitate to buy it again in another color for him,1
"This shirt is not well made or QC, it looks like they sew the QC label with washing label hence no QC the sewing machine treads on the collar are not uniform, a lot of treads hanging from the collars",2
My brother loves the shirt and it looks so great on him,1
Very well made and easy to wash and dry,1
Limited wrinkles which is awesome,1
Highly recommend,1
the collar does not flex as described,2
Same shirts you can get at JC Penny,0
"Looks good, feels great and is much appreciated",1
"Husband needed a couple new work shirts, he found this one &amp",0
he loves the color &amp,1
it fits well,1
Exactly what he needed,1
"The collar on the shirt which was shipped was far too small for my neck, even though I ordered the collar that my neck measures at",2
"Perhaps if they had shipped the correct size shirt, I would be able to have a more favorable opinion",2
Had to iron this shirt so that was a disappointment,2
It food great and is comfortable,1
A different colored shirt that I got last year was made in Indonesia and it fit good,1
This year's shirt supply is made poorly in Ethiopia and didn't fit well,2
This is not acceptable,2
Good fit except too big on the arms,0
this white color is Flimsy than the other colored shirts i ordered otherwise still a good buy for the sale price,2
need a t shirt under this otherwise very nice shirt,0
we are pleased,1
These shirts were a great value for our groomsmen,1
Very impressed with shirt,1
The fabric is soft and looks very dressy,1
My husband especially liked the collar,1
He said it was very comfortable,1
"Great dress shirt, reasonable price",1
The fit was spot on w/ a little flex just in case,0
These shirts have no more give in the neck than any other dress shirt I_e worn in the past,0
That said the shirts fit fine and look nice,1
Liked the color of shirt as pictured and fit extremely well--correct sizing as advertised,1
Thinner than previous purchase of the same,0

Great deal _,1
"Would  buy again ,,,",1
Very happy,1
"The description stated DRESS SHIRT, LONG SLEEVE",0
It even stated the cuffs were adjustable,0
Guess what??? SHORT SLEEVE,0
Very disappointing,2
Who wears a short sleeve for dress? Honestly,0
__,0
not a comfortable material nor wrinkle free,2
Great looking shirt,1

"Excellent material, fits in all the right places",1
Look good,1
Nice shirt,1
Very good,1
This shirt fit fine it wasn't a tailored fit so it provided me with a nice fit that was comfortable,1

I'm very happy with these shirts,1

Nice comfortable fabric too,1
I'll probably order some more,1
It_ perfect,1
The color was just like the picture too,1
"Good price, better than Belk's price with discounts and coupons",1
I pulled this out of the bag and there was a stain,2
It almost looked like makeup,0
Really kind of gross,2
Probably will be returning it/finding a different seller,2
Contacting customer service now,0

It_ just ok,0
I was hoping for a little extra room around the neck,0
It_ about an inch too big,2
Nice shirt,1
Not as happy as I was in the 90's,0
"Excellent fit, excellent quality",1
Great value for an odd size,0
The collar does not stretch at all,2
This is false advertising and I am returning it,2
This shirt is so see through that you can see my son's skin and nipples through the fabric,2
Pretty much a waste of money as it will no be acceptable for an orchestra concert,2
"Great for, good fabric",1
I love this shirt,1
As expected,0

Elegent shirt that's just the right size and smooth to the touch,1
Perfect for any job or just going out,1
Fits great _,1
"Looked nice, wrinkle badly and should be ironed to look good",0
The comfort and flexibility of the shirt amazing product,1
Ordered many shirts of the same size and sleeve length,0
The arm length varies greatly on each shirt,1
Mostly too short,2
Fit great,1
"A mi esposo le quedo muy bien, es comoda , fresca y elwgante",0
It was a great purchase,1
It fit perfectly and stretches in the shoulders which makes it more comfortable than my other dress shirts,1
Mi husband loves it,1
These shirts are my favorite,1
This dress shirts it's awesome and is very comfortable,1
I'm about to order more of them,1

Fabric is thin so is a little see-through,0
Sleeve is shorter than expected so this is the minus 1 star,2
"Other than that, this is a very nice shirt",1
Fits nicely,1
"For reference I'm 5' 8""",0
172cms,0
tall and my weight is 240 lbs,0
109 kgs,0
"Neck 18"", Chest 46"", Waist 45"" and my jeans are 36"" x 30""",0
Thanks,1
This is a nice white shirt for dress or professional wear,1
"And it has a chest pocket, which is a feature that is rapidly disappearing in men_ shirts",0
The fit is _s expected,1
"The fit is neither slim, nor baggy",0
"in other words, _egular is appropriate",0
The fabric is a bit lighter than the shirts my husband usually wears,0
He prefers a somewhat heavier fabric,0
I liked the weight of this one,1
Then comes the acid test: the laundering,0
"Coincidentally I washed this shirt with a white oxford-cloth dress shirt, a fabric that is my usual gold standard for wrinkle-free performance",0
The Van Heusen was ALMOST as wrinkle-free as the oxford cloth,0
Fit as expected in neck and sleeves,1
"I will add this caution to gentlemen out there who want to buy dress shirts online without trying them on, make sure to measure your neck and arms",0
"Or go to a department store and try some on, then come back to Amazon and save some money",0
Back to the shirt,0
"Very nice, high end look",1
The one thing I wasn_ quite sure on was the _tretch advertised,0
Just standard fabric,0
"Doesn_ detract at all from the quality or attractiveness of the shirt, just confused me a little because of the stretch advertised in the labeling",0
Still looks good either way,1
"It_ nice and light, as well as breathable which is something we can all appreciate when the temperature rises, or when you find yourself at a stuffy event",1
"Overall good fit, good packaging, hit it with an iron or steamer for a few minutes, toss on a tie and you_e ready to go",1
It will have you looking sharp in no time,0
"I was surprised to see this shirt was made in in Ethiopia, first time I ever had anything made there",0
The quality is standard Van Heusen,0
My 16,0
5 neck/34-35 sleeves were perfectly sized,0
"I wish they would stop using pins in the packaging, other than that the shirt did not disappoint",2
This is a great shirt,1
It's made with an ultra soft material that is lightweight and comfortable to wear on hot or cold days,1
It looks good with a suit and under a jacket as well,1
It washes well and only needs a light ironing,1
It's a vivid white and there are no flaws that I can find,1
4 stars,1
"I appreciate that you took the time to read my review, Thank you",0
You can never have enough white shirts so I picked this one up for my husband,1
He_ 5,0
10 and about 210 lbs the fit is perfect on him,0
He looks so handsome in it with his black suit on,1
"I washed it on the delicate cycle, and low setting for the dryer took it out as soon as it done and no ironing was needed",0
I'm always excited to try out a new Van Heusen,1
"This regular fit is indeed regular - not too athletic anywhere and can handle a little bit of ""gut""",0
"Finishes, seams, touch and feel, color - all up to par with this brands track record - good plus",0
I got the 32''-33'' sleeve - a little short for me at 6' tall,0
This shirt handled the first round of laundry perfectly,0
Strong buy recommendation,1
For $20,0
at time of review,0
", this is a really nice dress shirt",1
The color is saturated and the material is comfortable and nice without looking cheap,1
Fit as expected,1
Perfect work or church staple,1
The flex fit is more comfortable for my husband than the more structured shirts,0
"Would recommend, especially for the price",1
"In my experience, this brand holds up to washing really well",1
This is the size my husband wears in dress shirts and this shirt matched his body type to the T,0
5 8 165,0
It wasn_ too loose or too tight,0
The material is soft almost silky in texture,1
The collar  and color is just as advertised in the picture,1
These are excellent modern versions of a classic men's dress shirt,1
"Sizing is as expected, which is of course par for the course for a venerable brand like Van Heusen",1
Flex feature improves comfort,1
"Van Heusen makes a good shirt, and I've owned them and Arrow for many years",1
"This shirt is a continuation of the line, well made, good value, comfortable, full cut",1
"It's nice enough to wear with a suit, or for a more casual look without a tie",1
"You get classic looks, quality and price",1
A good value,1
So far these shirts have not shrunken significantly,0
Hope that continues,0
My only issue with this shirt is the material it's made of,2
I just don't like this stretchy blend of cotton and polyester,2
It's thin and doesn't feel natural,2
I would pick a 100% cotton shirt over this one any day,0
Great shirt with comfortable and perfect fit,1
Great material that looks amazing,1
I don_ own many dress shirts and though this was free I now want to go purchase more options,0
"This shirt feels to be of the cheapest material, and does not feel at all like ""stretch"" material",2
The shirt is also SEE THROUGH in white,0
"Meaning, you can actually see your skin through it",0
Not a quality dress shirt,2
"Fits as expected, workmanship seems to be good",1
"Material is good, smooth and not flimsy",1
Great quality comfortable material with a stretchy neck,1
It fit as expected and I found no visible defects,1
"Fit like it was made for me, true to size",1
The packaging was very nice,1
I would highly recommend,1
"The dress shirt is good, especially for the price",1
The only thing is that the material its very thin,0
Bought this for my husband,0
It fits well and he likes that the neck expands just a little making wearing a tie more comfortable,1
As pictured,1
"the shirt that showed was mislabeled, was way to small",2
Shirt arrived open and had been either tried on or worn,2
Can_ believe it was such a mess,2
"Very comfortable, good finish",1
Fits very nice,1
I have ordered 2 Blue frost shirts and both had different flaws,2
I wear Van Heusen shirts all the time specifically this style and i have never had any issues like this,2
The fabric just didnt seem right to me either,2
I question the sellers product legitimacy,2
Purchased for my husband to wear to work at a large box store,0
He has wide shoulders and long arms and he said the future was perfect and the shirts give him great range of motion for work and they are very comfortable,1
Very nice shirt,1
Very comfortable,1
Very stylish,1
"It appears so be fairly sturdy, I like to roll my sleeves up to the elbow and every now and then my bony elbows will rip the sleeve open if it doesn't ride up when I bend my arm",0
With this Van Heusen Dress shirt so far so good,1
"Each time I've worn this one, recently, we've had 90 degree plus days, yet I don't feel uncomfortable wear and working in, it is not sticking too me unlike some shirts",1
"The collar is a good fit for me, that is a big deal for me as it is hard to find a shirt that has long enough arms, a good chest size and not too tight or too loose in the neck",1
Most off the shelf shirts that fit elsewhere try to strangle me or make me look as though I have lost too much weight too quickly,0
"Bottom line, I like this shirt",1
It is amazing how much a little stretch material in a dress shirt to make it much more comfortable,1
"I found that the cut of the shirt was perfect, it has a tailored fit",1
"I_ 5 6, 165 and wearing a size 15",0
I also like how it is styled,1
"Clean white, fabric doesn_ seem to hold stains, and the collar lays nicely",1
this shirt is awesome,1
the money I well spent the quality amazing  it feels very comfortable it moves with you the flex material great I'm ordering another shirt right at this moment thank you,1
"I ordered 17"" Neck 32""-33"" Sleeve",0
X-Large,0
Quality is good and fitting is perfect,1
I usually have hard time finding correct sleeve size,0
I will be ordering few more,1
I purchased this as a gift and he loved it,1
It fit perfectly and true to size,1
"Good quality he said, so I am happy if he is happy",1
Excelente calidad estoy muy satisfecho,0
Muy buena camisa para el trabajo,0
good product,1
Dear Potential Buyers,0
before you buy I would like you to know a few facts about this product,0
The color is cream - close to ivory,0
"it is not white, in fact it is far from white",0
If you have a high performance job,0
"a waiter,  a barman or you spend some  hours in office wearing the  suit",0
", than you will feel like wearing a plastic bag - wet and uncomfortable with strong sensation of aching",2
The information,0
on website and on shirt's  label indicates that it is 100% cotton,0
It is not,2
"It is 100% polyester, uncomfortable to use",2
"This shirt,  20-30 minutes after ironing, will lose it shape, and you will look like a rickshaw  driver after very long rainy day",2
"The price for 100% polyester shirts is usually 70% cheaper  than cotton, because difficult to wear in cold or hot days",2
"From the ethical point, looks like ""Amazon"" is taking very  strange business direction, by selling polyester as a cotton",2
"It is not ""Essential"" it is ""Strategic Mistake""",2
I returned the item,2
Not acceptable,2
I purchased a 16??32-33??French Blue shirt,0
"Very much liked the color, the fabric, the fit when I first tried it on",1
It washed up nicely,1
I liked it so much that I anticipated buying two to three more,1
It seems like the shirt is just too small across the back,2
I'm really happy I decided to order one of these shirts,1
"I was looking to buy a red/blue tattersall and when I saw this, I figured it was worth a shot",1
"For the money, it is a fantastic value and I would have given it 5 stars had it not run pretty small",1
6'3 250,0
", I expect a regular fit shirt to be relatively loose fitting given the measurements I buy",0
17,0
"5, 35",0
"This will not fit you if you are, sorry, very overweight or obese",0
"I am going to order a 18"" neck next time and see how it fits",0
I bought this dress shirt from Amazon Basics and another dress shirt of the same size / color Kirkland brand from Costco as a test for which $20 men's long sleeve dress shirt is better,0
Costco wins,2
Comfortably,0
The Amazon Basics shirt looks thinner and cheaper,1
It's fabric is a bit stiffer and less comfortable,2
"Either the sleeves are a bit shorter for the listed size, or the shirt shrank -- neither of those options is good",2
"Lint and fuzz cling to the Amazon shirt more, even though I washed it and the Costco shirt at the same time",2
These dress shirts are great,1
"They are a nice white, fit well and awesome price",1
Can?t beat 20 bucks for a dress shirt anywhere else,1
some people might like that tight though,1
So returned it no problem and got the regular fit and couldn?t be happier,1
Absolutely love it,1
Must buy,1
Oh and it really is non-iron,1
Comes out of wash great,1
This shirt surpassed my expectations for this price point,1
I have been ordering another brand from Amazon and the quality of the Amazon Essentials shirt is so much better and the fit is better,1
"For all my dress shirts, this is going to be the shirt I buy",1
"When I lose a little weight, I will be buying Amazon Essential pants also",1
Everything I have bought from Amazon Essentials so far has been excellent quality at an affordable price,1
I'm hooked,1
I bought this for my husband after I ran one of his white shirts in a colored wash and it came out gray,0
He put this on as soon as I have it to him and really loves it,1
I did notice that it is a bit see-through,2
This is a very well constructed shirt for the average size man,1
"highly recommend, ",1
It is way to small in the stomach,2
The sleeves and neck size are fantastic,1
Fantastic price,1
This is the first time I have been disappointed by Amazon Essentials and I have bought several other items - which were all good,2
The fabric used for this shirt is just not right,2
Too shiny and doesn't feel right,2
"Super grabbed lint, etc",2
Reminds me of a gangster shirt,2
Someone at Amazon Essentials dropped the ball,2
I will never wear this shirt,2
"Way undersized, bought a Van Heusen shirt with this one, exact same neck and sleeve measurements",2
I give it one star as the fabric was bright and colorfull,2
"I got the Van Heusn, a Steve Land, and 2 AMazon shirts",0
"Steve Land was 10$ more than others Van Husen was 23, Amazon was $20",0
Steve Land was the best as the black was a real black,0
Fit was great and so was the fabric 100% cotton,0
Still thin,0
Amazon Essential 2nd best,1
"NOT the Solid Poplin, this was wrongly sized",2
", as it is almost a black indigo",2
"You cant tell unless you hold it up with a actual black shirt or if you are matching black pants, it can be a issue in day time",2
"I also purchased a 2nd Amazon shirt which fit great and the fabric was not see through, and it was more a casual threading as it has a micro wrinkle look vs a candle wax like dress shirt look",1
"This is a great shirt also, yet suffers the dye ink of the indigo black, and not a true black",2
Still I am keeping these and returning the VanHusen,1
"I was never a fan of them, and now I know why a few discerning others felt the same",2
:-,0
"This shirt is the Wrinkle resistant, regular fit, and besides the size measures it shows a L/XL/XXL indication",0
"The ""Poplin essential"" does not show that and the midsection stomach area runs rather tight for a 37"" sleeve with 18""neck",2
The midsection was a tight 46,0
"I love the quality of this shirt, the fitting, and the price",1
This shirt outshines the $60,1
0,0
men's warehouse,0
shirts I usually buy in terms of all of the above,0
"I am 5'7"" and 180#, a little on the chunky side",0
I used to lift weights so my chest,0
I dont know the size,0
This review is based on wearing the shirt once all day,0
I ordered an 18 1/2 neck 34-35 sleeve length,0
I am 6 feet 250 LBS,0
I am pleasantly surprised that the shirt fit perfectly and irons easily,1
It did not feel like I was wearing a piece of linen--it did not become wrinkly even after wearing it all day,1
The fabric kept it's shape all day like the comparable premium store bought brand,1
Note that this shirt is a classic fit with the traditional fabric,1
not the stretch-flex kind,1
These were a replacement because I couldn't find the shirt I purchased prior,0
It appears Amazon replaced a prior shirt with this version,0
In any case I bought these for my boyfriend and the material is definitely a lower quality,2
Not nearly as soft and the neck chafes him so badly that he can't wear these shirts,2
you'll also want to be sure not to wash it with anything else because it picks up everything else in the washer and dryer,2
It's a shame really because the shirt itself fits perfectly fine,1
Disappointed and searching again,2
I just got this a few days ago and washed it,0
It fits well,1
The only issue I have is that the collar stays can come out in the washing machine/dryer and get lost,2
"over the past years, I have only bought shirts that have collar stays sewn in so they don?t get lost",0
"I basically drilled two small holes in the stays and sewed them into the collar, and they now stay in",0
"At this price, And otherwise good quality, I am happy to buy more and see the collar stays in the other shirts also",1
I was looking for a full cut shirt that could be worn untucked,0
I ordered 15,0
5X32-33,0
"Also, the sleeves were definitely 32 and not 33",2
"I'm 5'10"" and weigh 170",0
I ordered this shirt and it ripped in the area pictured after a few wears,2
There was no excessive use or wear at that point in my opinion so I submitted a return,0
Amazon graciously offered me a new shirt,1
"I was supposed to return the other one, and didn?t so I ended up being charged for both",0
That?s fine because it was my fault for not returning the shirt,0
the one pictured,0
Just a heads up that these shirts appear to have a flaw,2
"Brand new, the cut seems as nice as high quality",1
"brands, and the fabric seems to be higher quality,",1
also,0
I bought two of these shirts because I needed the 16 1/2 neck size,0
The fit is perfect and the quality is first class,1
Buy this shirt,1
You won't be disappointed,1
Also noticing that the quality of the shirts does not stand up to dry cleaners,2
Too bad,2
"With regard to material, these amazon 100% cotton shirts are not as high-quality as ""designer"" 100% cotton shirts like you could buy in department stores",2
"The problem is it's hard to find 100% cotton shirts in the department stores these days, at least out my way",0
"The shirt fits well--not that ""slim fit"" for guys that eat one lettuce leaf a day",1
"For the price, it's a very good shirt",1
"Shirt looks fantastic, and the collar is great for collar stays",1
Very good looking shirt and I am very pleased with it,1
Can use either casual or fully dressed up with a suit and tie,1
These shirts fit great and look very sharp,1
My only complaint is that the collars fabric is very rough,2
Wearing this shirt all day is impossible for me since it makes my neck feel raw,2
I solved this by buying a piece of disposable stick on fabric that serves as a collar protector,2
It?s the only way I can wear these shirts comfortably,2
Needed a white shirt for my husband to wear to our sons wedding,0
He has several expensive shirts that didn?t fit at the neck,0
He was uncooperative in going to the store to buy one so I tried Amazon because of the quick shipping,0
Great fit,1
Looked great and no one knew it was inexpensive,1
Thanks,1
You get what you pay for with this shirt,1
"The fabric is very thin and the sleeves are too short, particularly when you bend your arms",2
Suppose to be regular fit ???,0
Sizing okay,1
Style? Not so much,2
Picture makes it seem like small squares pattern,0
reality is fairly large ?plaid??- highly unflattering unless you?re a bean pole,0
So these shirts are supposed to be 100% cotton,0
The material is beyond stiff that it actually left scratch marks in my biceps,2
This shirt is really nice,1
I have to wear a dress shirt to work everyday and hate to spend a lot of money on them so the price right on this one so I gave it a chance,0
"It looks great, fits great and comes out of the dryer without wrinkles",1
Great shirt,1
"I was looking for a pink shirt to add to the single pink shirt that I have, and I clicked on a the color that I wanted",0
it was almost white,2
"I seldom return items, and did not return this shirt",0
I will simply use it as one of my white shirts,0
Lovely satin like fabric,1
Looking forward to buying more shirts from this brand,1
Only wish they were not so wasteful with the packaging,2
There are plastic inserts AND cardboard just to prop up the collar,2
The metal pins are also quite unnecessary,2
A great dress shirt,1
Comfortable and just the right weight,1
Nicely made with no loose threads,1
Fit is pretty much as expected,1
Seems to be holding up after being dry cleaned a few times,1
5 out of 5 stars,1
My only gripe is that I was expecting the stripes to be more subtle and less bold,2
"Otherwise it fit my 5???? 156lb frame perfectly and it?s suitable for casual Fridays, and with dress slacks and no tie",1
I wanted a new white all-cotton shirt,0
"Contrary to some other reviews, my shirt had a front pocket",0
"I am 5'8"" and 130"" and the 15"" x 32""/33"" shirt fit me fine",1
I would have liked for the sleeves to have been,2
My only caution is that the shirt has not been washed yet so I cannot say anything about shrinkage,0
I love this shirt,1
"It is nicely breathable, fits like it should, and the collar keeps its form",1
Iron it with a little spray starch and it looks like it came from dry cleaners,1
"33""-34"" is the normal length of long sleeves that I wear",0
"Fortunately, the shirt fit my son perfectly",1
"Since I really liked the shirt, I reordered 34""-35"" sleeve length and it fits me well",1
The shirt fits great and looks good out of the dryer,1
Unfortunately even after ironing it looks like it has static cling,2
I like that the Amazon essential regular fit shirts can be ordered by neck and sleeve size,1
The Amazon shirt fit at the waist is not baggy  and tucks in nice,1
Unfortunately I will not be purchasing again due to the unprofessional look of the shirt even after ironing,2
*Purchased for my husband to wear weekly with church pants,0
and suit,0
The only thing that we don?t love about it is the fact that the sleeves can?t take cuff links,2
"These shirts, made in Vietnam, are labeled ""Regular Fit",0
""" IME, they are not",2
"They seem to be more ""slim fit",2
""" I bought several on account of the price",0
Returned them all,2
"After all that, I will say they are made of good material and nicely sewn",1
I was hoping for a shirt that fit like a Brooks Brothers Regent fit 16,0
5 or 17 by 37,0
This is definitely tighter and too short to be a 37 sleeve length,2
I don't love the fabric,2
The sleeves are tight on my arms,2
"I'm 6'4"" 235, not huge arms",0
The neck was to tight ,2
He looked so handsome,1
Neck was good,1
"I shop mens because the fabric is thicker, warmer and overall it is higher quality than what is found in women's department",1
Length of sleeves was good,1
I will look for a larger size,0
"A great-looking, great-performing white shirt",1
Wrinkle free and not too see-through or anything like that,1
Fit as expected,1
This shirt is really a great value for the money,1
Thanks,1
This product was much too small for a regular fit 17 34/35,2
It was almost 2 inches from closing around my chest and stomach,2
"I'm 6'3"" 250 lbs and this size in other manufacturers fits just fine",0
Amazon should stay out of the manufacturing business and just ship products,2
"If you want a good shirt for about $20, these are great",1
I now have 3 different colors and very happy with them,1
Highly recommend them,1
"Nice, regular white shirt",1
Disappointed just a little that I had to get such a large neck size to get the right body fit,2
"I am assuming that the shirt fits well, because my brother is kinda picky",1
He asked for them because he liked wearing the same manufacturer and style in the past,1
Shirt was not as described,2
Amazon description was white shirt with blue stripes,2
Delivered shirt was white shirt with LARGE BROWN and blue stripes,2
Online picture also only showed narrow blue stripes,2
Very disappointing,2
I ordered a black one because my son needed to wear black shirt for his orchestra concerts,0
Unfortunately the shirt looks more dark navy than black amongst other players wearing black,2
Too late to return,0
"If you need real black shirt, do not order this",2
I love the fit on this shirt and the quality is great for the $,1
"I am 6' 2"" and 180 lbs",0
5?? 17 1/2 neck,0
these shirts are affordable AND fit great,1
Nice material,1
We?re buying them in all the colors,0
Amazing for the price,1
Even without the great price a solid build of a shirt,1
I just got the shirt so my review is based on one try- on and no day to day wearing,0
The shirt looks to be well made,1
The material appears to be of good quality and is classy looking,1
I gave it four star because I have not had a chance to wear it for an extended time,0
Tight fit in the arms and chest,2
This is such a comfortable and professional work shirt,1
"If you are bulkier in this area and prefer the shirt slightly loose, then get a size bigger to avoid the ""slim fit",0
""" Would definitely order more of these",1
This brand is my sons go to,1
"It is well-made, is offered with longer arm which is always a problem for the man in my family",1
"Excellent cut, excellent fabric and as a seamstress, this is very important to me",1
fits well although I tried the slim fit which I usually have and that was tight,0
This fits just right,1
good quality and great value for money,1
Received the item crumpled in a plastic bag not the original packaging,2
I'm a professional,0
I like to use new shirts right out of the package,2
Impossible with this,2
It needs to go to the dry cleaners to be pressed,2
Now I have to wait for a refund before I can replace the shirt,2
This has never happened before,2
I'm quite disappointing,2
I washed and dried the shirt after trying them on to make certain they fit,0
My Van Heusen shirt did not shrink,0
I would not recommend the Amazon Essentials shirts at all,2
I plan to return them and buy more Van Heusen shirts,2
"Also, the fabric is very thin for a dress shirt",2
"Accordingly, I returned it to Amazon and received a refund",0
a little tight at the waist,2
I really love the Amazon Essentials line,1
"For everyday casual clothing, you can't beat them",1
I own 3 shirts like these and they look great after 3 months of washing and wearing,1
I recommend looking at the polo,0
golf,0
shirts too,0
"This is a beautiful shirt, really looks good with all colors of sweaters",1
Nice fall and winter look,1
Thank you,1
I?m never buying another type of dress shirt,2
This is thin and cool so I?m looking forward to the summer with this shirt,2
This shirt fits like the general sizes as a regular fit,0
This is the dress shirt for the professionals,0
I?m 5????and about 200 lbs,0
I got a 17??and 34/35 sleeve length and it fits great,1
This seemed like more of a slim fit shirt,0
The cheat was tighter and so were the sleeves,2
Plus the pocket was placed a little to high on the shirt,2
I returned them,2
Surprisingly nice and good fitting shirt,1
Hard to believe that it's 100% cotton,1
Much Much nicer than any 100% cotton wash and wear shirt that I've ever owned,1
This I have been wearing to work,0
looks good,1
Fit as expected and I have had no issues,1
Held up over a couple of washes too,1
I like the price for the item and it fit me true to size,1
"This shirt was very tight around the chest and midsection, unlike every other shirt this size that I own/wear",2
Cannot comfortably wear it,2
Disappointing because it looked to be a nicely made shirt for a very reasonable price,2
It wasn't washed or dried - no shrinkage,0
Just runs small/tight,2
Huge value,1
"These shirts are constructed well, fit as expected, and don't cost a ton",1
Makes you wonder how companies can sell their shirts at $100+ when these are available,1
The sleeves and collar fit very nicely,1
Real decent shirt for the money,1
Good fit for a big guy,1
"Big as in fat, not athletic",2
"I have been wearing this on Zoom calls for 7 months now, hasn't needed ironing or washing yet",1
I normally wear a 17 1/2 and I am a 2 xl so like a 50 chest,0
I ordered a 18 /36 and the neck is way big and the body is made for a basketball player not a former Defensive lineman,2
The good thing is its 20,1
00 and a nice fabric and weight,1
Product made in China,0
For some reason fit somewhat small,2
I have other shirts made in Bangladesh and they are a much better fit for the same size,2
"Note as mentioned in a couple of reviews, the shirt is a little tight in the way it is made",2
I ordered a 16,0
my normal size,0
and it just fits,1
My recommendation is order one half neck size up from your normal size,0
a 17 instead of 16,0
"Other than that, it is a very nice shirt",1
Very comfortable yet durable dress shirt,1
Have ordered many times,1
Good value,1
Surprisingly good quality shirt for the money,1
It ironed nicely out of the dryer and looks like any other more expensive shirt,1
Shirt came wrapped like I bought it at a suit store,1
Material felt like high quality,1
No odor,1
Ready to go out of the bag and not flimsy at all,1
Highly recommend this seller &amp,1
product,0
Fantastic Classic cut and construction-moderately priced,1
I love it,1
Great for everyday to the office use,1
"The material is good, the cut is very nice, the size is true",1
wonderful style and texture,1
"It just didn't fit me at 6'2"" and 230lbs",2
"Whatever the fabric is, it is very thin, and transparent",2
If you don't wear an undershirt your body will show right through the fabric,2
"With an undershirt, the undershirt will show",2
"This short was bought before by someone that decide not to keep it, it came completely unfolded inside a plastic bag with nothing written",2
"this is an Amazon Essential product, can?t believe your quality control dis not catch it",2
worst packaging experience in more than 10 years with Amazon,2
It was a steal for what I paid for it,1
Very good quality and looks great,1
"Good quality overall, fits well, comfortable",1
The shirt came with a dirty package and a black smudge on the white shirt,2
"Further, the material was cheap and rough",2
"This 15 1/2 32-33 is not a regular fit although the label says ""Regular""",2
More importantly I normally find 32-33 length a bit long,0
"These sleeves are way to short, like 30-31",2
The neck is not too accurate either,2
Chinese garments come in  batches and this batch is mismarked,2
And I mean compared to other men's large sizes,0
"Seems well made, used for a play, and wearable, just not as comfortable",2
Disappointed with the size,2
Every other company is true to fit,0
This one doesn?t close,2
Very upsetting,2
Love these shirts,1
Highest quality and fit of any other brand of white shirts I have purchased,1
I took a chance on it and love it,1
The quality of the material is comparable to that of the Kenneth Cole shirts that I previously purchased,1
I really liked this shirt which was decently priced,1
$20 ,0
", although I have enjoyed other economy-priced shirts of comparable quality for less",0
My only suggestion is that it could be $2 less per shirt to be really competitive,0
This is a high quality shirt at less than half the price you would find in the stores,1
I highly recommend it,1
Comfortable dress shirt for work,1
Irons easily,1
I don't often wear dress shirts so this was perfect for me,1
Less expensive that other shirts,1
product fits great for my physique and texure very good for good price,1
keep up the good job amazon and their vendors as i feel,1
I love these shirts,1
For the price this shirt can not be beat,1
"Nice fit, and the collar looks great",1
Just make sure you buy some nice collar stays,0
Great shirt,1
Classic fit doesn't mean full,0
It's still tailored,0
I couldn't find it in town,0
"So, got it online and I'm happy with it",1
Nice shirt for my new suit,1
Came right on time shirt is as expected,1
I liked this shirt,1
"It fitted as expected, and it was an excellent purchase for the price",1
The shirt is acceptable in fit and material,1
Looks good and for the price is a good vlue,1
Quality of cloth and stitching is good,1
The material is thinner than I was expecting,2
He seems to them,0
They do seem easier to get get wrinkles out of,2
"Great shirt, great price",1
I ordered 2 more when they became available,1
"I bought the size 17"" 34L and needed 17 "" 36 make sure to check size before buying",0
These are more than sufficient for my needs,1
"A good looking, well made, comfortable fitting shirt at a surprisingly low price",1
I will definitely be buying Amazon Essentials shirts again,1
Great materials,1
Just a good 100 percent cotton shirt love it,1
And wrinkle free,1
Best shirt I bought so far,1
Terrible,2
Yellowed cotton like they had been sitting around for years,2
I am amazed with the good quality of this shirt,1
I?ll keep buying for work,1
The material looks and feels good,1
Sizes run small,2
The size I ordered should be a little bigger then what you sent,2
It seems to be titer the other shirts I already own,2
Very comfortable,1
Looks nice,1
Easy with a tie due to spread collar,1
Gets compliments every time I wear it,1
Low maintenance,1
Fabric seems to be quite lightweight,1
Have not washed it yet to see how it looks after washing,0
Really like this shirt,1
Fits good,1
Good price,1
Excellent value for the money,1
The shirt came with a fit exactly as expected,1
Looks like a shirt worth twice what I spent,1
Good basic white shirt for my teen to wear with a suit 3-4 times a yr,1
For the price this is a nice shirt,1
It fit perfectly,1
Out of the bag there are not super sharp creases,0
I was in a hurry and wore it out of the bag,0
Decent for the money,1
I have a gentleman should have pressed white dress shirts to wear,0
"At this price I bought 5, one for each day of the week",0
"Good quality, good fit and the cloth is soft",1
Wow,1
This wrinkle resistant shirt looks perfect right out of the dryer,1
Like it actually had been ironed,1
Will purchase again,1
I had to return the shirt because the shirt is made of a super thin material in which an undershirt can be visible,2
This shirt is not cut out to be used for business purposes,2
My husband loves these and wants no other shirts now,1
Many people complained of the slim fit - for him it was perfect and had no bubble in the back like many lower cost shorts have,1
dress shirt for Church and I should get a free shirt or a refund with a 1/2 larger in the neck size and see how that works,2
I guess its time to go to Macy`s,2
which I hate going to the malls,2
I`ve bought 83 items in the past year from Amazon,0
Hmmmmm,0
"Nice dress shirt, no wrinkles and looks sharp",1
The price was also nice,1
Launders well,1
returned it as not as described,2
"It should have been described as a red and blue tattersall, not a red tattersall",2
Too long blew thigh almost to the knee,2
Shirt sleeve length is 32/33 so why the shirt is too long in length,2
"VERY well made, actually better than some of the more expensive brands, and irons",1
yes irons,1
like a dream,1
Fits fine and good value with 2 pack,1
Good shirt for the price,1
It's NOT wrinkle resistant,2
It's 100% cotton,0
Not sure why it says it is,2
A great shirt at this price,1
Very pleased with this product,1
I really like the quality and the feel of this shirt,1
It feels like a premium shirt- not a $20 bargain,1
I like loose shirts so the size is good for me,1
Plus I am a small guy,0
So the fit will prob be perfect for a regular sized guy,1
Just ordered another 3 shirts,1
"Not to bad, a little big and stiff",2
Color is great no fading,1
This fabric feels like a quality shirt,1
I will be buying more,1
This is a super nice shirt and especially at this price point,1
Quality seems to match that of name brand shirts I?ve bought in the past,1
I bought this shirt in my normal shirt size and it fit as if it were two sizes too small,2
Waist too small for reg fit 17,2
5 neck,2
The shirt fits perfect,1
Sleeve length was solid it wasn't too tight,1
I will order 2 more shirts soon,1
Fits as expected,1
The fabric is not too thin,0
Good quality and fit,1
Good product,1
Black color fades fast,2
High quality,1
Good fit,1
Not too baggy like many off the rack shirts,1
"Also, not super short like those you often find in this price range",1
"I'm 6' 2"" amd fit",0
I wear a 16,0
"5"" neck and 34/35 length",0
I ordered the same here and fit perfect,1
The quality has led me to look at other Amazon Essential clothing options,1
"CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP, FOCUS ON THE SELLING AND STOP TRYING TO BECOME A DESIGNER",1
I just wish Amazon did a better job of keeping other styles of this shirt in stock,0
Nice shirt and a good bargain,1
The entire sleeve just ripped,2
It was not abused in any way,0
Don't waste your money,2
Arrived just in time for me to wear to a wedding,1
Fit perfectly and looked good,1
The shirt is very uncomfortable I am going to try to return it,2
Good luck,1
I returned this item due to fabric quality,2
It is way too thin,2
Great print,1
"Surprised by fit, have never bought an Amazon brand shirt, very happy",1
I like the spread collar and fit,1
Looks great in a suit and tie,1
Good value for money quickly shipped,1
I bought this for my Mitsuba cosplay and it works perfectly,1
It's the right length and size plus it color matched his canon clothes perfectly,1
"If you're gonna cosplay Mitsuba, this shirt is perfect",1
"The shirt just felt right on me, I'm planning on buying two more",1
Good quality and was designed well,1
Washes up well,1
Great and affordable dress shirt,1
Very good quality for the price,1
My husband love this shirt,1
It doesn?t wrinkle,1
fit well and seems like it's nice quality,1
"Fits as expected, though a little loose in the chest",0
Arms are longer than advertised,2
3rd amazon shirt I have bought they have been very good quality and fit perfect,1
"Unlike some of the other shirts I?ve bought, I like the length of this one",1
I don?t have to keep tucking it into my pants,1
Fits smaller than sized,2
This is an exceptional shirt,1
Better than expected,1
KUDOS,1
"Great fabric, Great fit, great length",1
"Wore well, washed well",1
Best shirt I've had for suit and tie,1
Nice,1
"These are great, especially considering the price",1
Great shirt for the price and washed great and really doesn?t need pressing,1
I purchase men's shirts because they have pockets and I'm a photographer,1
That pocket is super,1
The shirt fit tight across the chest,2
I can wear it with a tank underneath in the fall,0
Value for the money,1
"Great quality, low price",1
Looks super,1
These run small,2
"Normal, good quality shirt",1
Good,1
Overall the material is pretty good Shirt is a little snug and sleeves were longer than expected,2
Very comfortable since I can't find Kenneth Cole shirts anymore in my size,1
"Nice shirt, looks nice and easy to take care of fair price",1
I normally wear a 36 in Sleeve,0
I ordered a 36/37 and was Way To Long,2
Everything else on the Shirt was perfect,1
Great fit looking to buy more when in stock,1
a little tight,2
Well tailored looked great felt great,1
good quality,1
The item had clearly been open before and repackaged in a messy manner,2
Have had others before and none like this,1
"Las 3 camisas salieron como esperaba, pero fueron entregadas por el vendedor, como si fueran 3 camisas compradas por separado, a pesar de ser cobradas con la misma factura",0
Good,1
They are almost a yellowish color not a nice simple white color,2
This is a good fitting and good looking shirt,1
Very comfortable,1
"I like the longer length, so that that it stays tucked in better",1
Very nice shirt with a nice pocket as promised and very good fit,1
I was very happy,1
Perfect fit just a little short on the sleeves,1
Good purchase at a great price,1
I'll be back to buy more,1
i ordered a size 18 and it feels like it runs a bit tight compared to other brands,2
The quality of this shirt is wonderful for the price with its sturdy collar and cuffs,1
It has kept its color after numerous washes now with no signs of fading,1
I recommend Amazon Essential brand shirts to anyone who asks where to find a good shirt,1
Returned as shirt ws skimpy around the waist,2
"Very nice shirt, fits well, and good quality",1
"I have quite a few different brands of dress shirts, and I was incredibly impressed with the quality of this shirt",1
I will definitely be purchasing more,1
I would like to see more cuff options in the future,0
Tight,2
"Love It,not bad it all",1
Fine shirt for the price,1
"Great fit, the neck is perfect",1
GREAT PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE,1
Fits me like a tailored shirt,1
"I'm 6'2"" 220 and for $20 there is no better shirt out there",1
Medium weight fabric feels just right for colder weather,1
wonderful,1

Great shirt,1
Excellent shirt,1
The color was pale pink and perfect for a beach Valentine's Day wedding,1
The shirt was tight for the neck and sleeve length ordered,2

"Great fit, great price, fashionable",1
This was a shirt for my work,1
It was great and I may buy more,1

All white event,0
Fit poor,2
This review is for the white version,0
"It's a very nicely made shirt, and all of the seams are impeccable with a very small number of uncut threads in places",1
"I find it to be true to size, with one caveat regarding the sleeves",1
"These have removable collar stays, which is my preference",1
The one thing that I like the least,1
"and the reason for four stars instead of five, even at this price",0
is that the fabric is more transparent than my other shirts,2
"At least with the white color, you'll see skin or an undershirt through it",2
"All in all, a nice shirt and a good value at the",1
current,1
$20 price point,1
"This is a beautiful, pure white shirt",1
"When I get a new white shirt, I do not usually take it out of its wrap that it comes in, because white shirts begin to age immediately, they begin to turn yellowish or dull",0
"That is why men who must wear suits and ties to work must have a constant new supply of white shirts with long sleeves, in order to look their best,  The men get to the point when they can spot an older white shirt on a colleague, and then they start to think less of this colleague",0
"It must have long sleeves, as it is unprofessional to show your arms bare, even on the hottest days",0
This goes for women too - a businesswoman should not show bare arms,1
Or too much neck,0
It is unprofessional,0
"As for hemlines, below the knee is best",1
"I am an expert on dressing for the corporation, after having worked in the corporate world most of my life",0
"Anyway, back to this shirt",0
"As I said, I opened it and tried it on, and the sleeves are a bit too long",2
Too long is better than too short,0
"Too long can be solved with a pair of good, old-fashioned sleeve garters that are white so that they don't stand out",0
Sleeve garters can be found at haberdashery shops or sometimes in the men's department of a good department store,0
"So, you should have sleeve garters on hand",0
The size of a shirt is determined by the neck size,0
"Unfortunately, I have always had a sensitive neck, so I must get a shirt with a neck size of 17 at least",0
This way I won't be pulling at my neck all day long,0
"Also, your tie must be tied properly - a double Windsor knot is best",0
Please do not use a clip-on tie or a bow tie,0
I have at least 150 ties,0
I do not wear striped ties,0
"I prefer ties with abstract designs, paisleys, and other different designs, and ties must look fresh and unwrinkled",0
The color of a tie is important,0
"I tend toward blues, purples, and lavenders, with intricate patterns",0
I have a black tie with red polka dots on it that I wear when I don't feel good,0
"When you have many ties, you can just grab one in a hurry and wear it and it'll be fine",0
"Again, back to the shirt",0
"If you can see your skin through the shirt, you must wear a well-fitting white undershirt with short sleeves",0
"You don't want to show your nipples or an extremely hirsuit body, or any scars",0
I have had heart surgery so I always wear an undershirt,0

We got the purple tattersall and I have to say it's much better looking in person,0
The squares are a lot cleaner looking and not as small as they seem online,1
"The up-close listing pic shows it better, I think",0
"It is somewhat non-wrinkly, if I hang it right out of the dryer",1
"That's useful, since we're casual sorts",1
He says it's comfortable to wear as far as fit,0
"No binding, it moves nicely",1
"I do feel like it will wash softer over time, which will make it perfect",1
"Thanks for not using pins, though",1

Amazon brands are increasing their scope of affordable products especially in their clothing lines and this shirt is a great example,1
Equally at home under a suit or paired with blue jeans or khakis,1
Construction and cut share details of shirts costing twice the price,1
The collar stays for example are removable and can be replaced with new plastic ones or metal inserts if you have them,0
Stitching is clean and straight,1
"There's a single front breast pocket and the alignment of the fabric pattern matches perfectly the underlying shirt pattern, which is critical in plaid shirt especially",1
Price is very affordable especially if you compare it to any designer label,1
"I received the 32/33 inch sleeve and 16"" neck which I should not have ordered knowing my arms are extra long, and as expected, if I stretch my arms out straight, the sleeves are just not long enough",2
The cut leans more toward an athletic cut so works best with a slimmer torso,0
"All told, a very good value for the price",1
Attractive and versatile,1
A small deduction for the lower end weight and lack of heft of the fabric,0
"My husband seems to wear a popular size when it comes to dress shirts, so finding them in the local stores can be tough-so I often order online",0
For the most part-men's fitted shirts like this,0
sized collar and sleeve length,0
Granted many companies now make a 'regular' fit and slim fit,0
And the price point makes this a steal,1
"less than $25 for a well made, men's dress shirt?  Yes please",1
"Overall, I like this shirt -- it fits pretty well, it's attractive, and it's well-made",1
Fabric is strong without being rough or stiff,1
Seams are clean and strong,1
The plaid pattern is muted and attractive,1
Fits in with what all the other guys at my office job are wearing,1
My one complaint is that the arms/shoulders are a bit snug,2
"On the other hand, it's a dress shirt",0
"This is a quality dress shirt and a bargain at the price -- take that, designers",1
"I have deducted one star because arm movement is slightly restricted -- if you raise your arms, the shirt body lifts up as well",2
A little more give under the arms would be welcome,2
The finish seems topnotch -- no loose threads -- and the fabric is 100% cotton for breathability,1
The colors are subdued in this purple tattersall version -- they appear to be a muted purple and gray,0
"All in all, then, this is a great shirt for the money, and the movement issue probably won't matter to workers sitting at desks",1
It is hard to believe that this shirt can be offered at its price point,1
What an incredible value for $20,1
I usually wear a medium or 15 and 1/2 inch neck and the fit was right on,0
This is a very good quality dress shirt with modern styling,1
"The material is thin, which I like as it permits an undershirt and takes an iron well",1
Thicker shirt material tends to be more difficult to iron,0
"Cant speak about longevity, so you may want to bump up in quality if you plan to wear frequently",0
The design is a bit dull and it would be great if they had some more colorful and progressive patterns,2
And I mean that,0
"The shirt is 100%, all in, designed for the office",1
It's the archetypal dress shirt,0
it's not going to look casual,0
It's going to look like you're trying too hard,0
"Everything about the tailoring and materials just says ""wear me with a suit and tie",0
"The shirt itself fits just right to size - sleeve length is appropriate, shirttail length is appropriate, and the material is thin enough to be comfortable under a jacket",1
"In sum, a perfectly suitable, not-fancy-just-classic dress shirt",1
A very good piece,1
"I've had good luck with a lot of Amazon Essential stuff, so I'm really surprised about this shirt",2
"First, it doesn't fit well",2
The belly is too tight and the shoulders are,2
"they manage to be both tight and loose at the same time, don't ask me how",2
"The material is also somewhat stiff and uncomfortable, not at all like some of the others",2
"And lastly, the pattern is much bolder than the picture lead me to believe",2
This is a great basic dress shirt that goes with anything,1
It fits well and came out of the wash without shrinking,1
"I wear dress shirts several times a week, and this is one of my new favorites",1
The double pleats really help with range of shoulder motion,1
I'm adding this shirt in outher colors to my wardrobe ASAP,1
"The construction is of good quality, and it looks very polished and classy",1
Great value,1
I'm so happy to have this shirt,1
"I have been going to a million weddings, and a decent-quality dress shirt is exactly what I need",1
"The white is a good color, the material is comfortable, and overall, it's an attractive shirt",1
"Honestly, no one would ever know that it's ""Amazon Essentials"" brand",1
I highly recommend this shirt for anyone who tears through dress shirts and simply needs more in their arsenal,1
This is a well made white dress shirt,1
It is a must have for all men's wardrobes,1
"It comes in 6 colors: black, blue, lavender, light blue, pink and white",0
This shirt can be dressed up or down depending on what you wear with it,0
A very nice look,1
"I am pleased with the fit, quality, and feel of this shirt",1
PROS:,1
Excellent fit,1
100% cotton and keeps the body cool,1
Great looks,1
Machine washable,1
CONS:,2
The fit of this shirt rivals that of Banana Republic or J,1
Penny,1
"Give it a shot, you may like it",1
"I've worn a size 18 shirt for many years, and sometimes they're a little small, it all varies by manufacturer",0
"Wherever these are made, someone needs to give them an accurate sizing guide",2
This shirt is very stylish and fits perfectly for my size,1
The sizing is comparable and matches exactly with what I would expect compared to other shirts I have in this size,1
"I have gotten quite a few compliments from people at work when I wear this shirt, so that is a tremendous positive",1
I would definitely be interested in purchasing other shirt designs of this product,1
The shirt that was mailed to me is not the shirt in the main picture,2
Please be advised that this shirt has one basic pocket on the left and not two as shown in the picture,2
I am disappointed and think that this discrepancy should be addressed by Amazon,2
Beautiful shirt,1
Excellent quality,1
Fit my boyfriend perfectly,1
I ordered a large,0
The actual shirt is so much nicer than the online pictures,1
Colors are a little more vivid than what the pictures show,2
My boyfriend loved this shirt,1
This is a fairly good dress shirt,1
It is thin so it looks best if you wear an undershirt under it,0
It is basically an wrinkle free shirt,0
It has good stitching and is a good fit,1
The regular fit seems to run only slightly larger than some of our other dress shirts,0
We machine wash and line dry,0
This is a gorgeous shirt,1
"It is very well made, fits well and washes beautifully",1
"The fabric has very fine lines of purple and blue for a very subtle, mostly white, plaid",1
The shirt comes out of the dryer ready to wear,1
"Next time my hubby needs a dress shirt, we will definitely order another",1
"This shirt is a nice, basic white dress shirt",1
The fabric is a little thin,2
The rest is fine,1
"The fit, for me, is fine",1
It washes well and irons nicely,1
Fits as expected and the design is classic dress shirt,1
Crisp white color and the stitching is high quality,1
I also like the material very much too,1
It feels good yet holds its shape well even with no or very minimal starch and it is not too thin i,1
not see through at all,1
Pinpoint weave,1
Thi s white cotton dress shirt is ideal for the office,1
It isnicely constructed and true to size,1
I like the double pleat int eh bck and the rounded hem,1
The fabric is light and a bit transparent,2
Undershirts are visible underneath,0
It launders nicely and is a nice quality business essential,1
"This is more of a basic dress shirt, was hoping for a more modern/smooth fit",2
"The collar feels like it's on the larger side for the size, and the arms where the connect feel like they are a bit restricting, not a great fit, ends up being a bit boxy",2
Fits well and looks great,1
"It's a bit stiff, and even after some dry-cleaning there isn't much give",2
The material and the cut are similar to more expensive brands from major department stores,1
No way anyone would guess this is an Amazon Essentials brand shirt,1
"I will be ordering more as they are great for office, church or going out",1
The neck fits me perfectly,1
The sleeves are too long,2
The length of the shirt tails is ideal,1
The diameter of the chest is too large,2
"Nice quality construction, with good attention to finish details",1
"The fabric is attractive, and the spread collar works well with or without a tie",1
"It is amply cut across the belly, so if you prefer a trim or athletic fit, this is not for you",0
Very nice and crisp dress shirt,1
The tattersall plaid pattern is subtle,1
"Anyway , it has a really nice feel, 100% cotton",1
"An 18"" neck and a 36""37"" arm shouldn't have a chest/waist size for a 120 lb man",2
"These shirts were off the chart small, except in the neck and arm length",2
This could have been a Arrow shirt in the 1960s,0
Old school / classic mens' dress shirt,0
"Medium weight fabric, traditional cut and decent fabric",1
Should be good for many wearings,1
This is a well-made shirt,1
"subtle, tattersall pattern with purple lines, appropriately labeled ""essential""",1
Certainly versatile and comfortable,1
Can be worn with slacks or jeans,1
Good price too,1
This runs a bit big as often happens with Amazon shirts,2
It's a nice dress shirt in a comfortable fabric,1
"The fabric is bit thin, slightly see-through",2
A classic fit that?s not billow-y,2
What a concept,0
This fits great,1
Amazon clothing is on par with most mall/department store/big box retail in terms of quality,1
Great value,1
This fits the bill,1
It fits as expected and looks as pictured,1
Solid shirt,1
I have not had good luck finding a really nice dress shirt online,0
"Usually the fabric is too thin, the cut is too narrow, etc",0
This fits the bill perfectly,1
This shirt is a great fit for my husband,1
true to size,1
"He says it is comfortable and easy care, wrinkle-free",1
We've washed it a few times and it looks great,1
"Good price conscience shirt for my slender, tall sons",1
"Comfortable fabric, well-made",1
The pattern is nice and the colors subdued,1
Will wash easily and seems durable overall,1
Very nice quality for the price,1
Great work shirt,1
"The  34/35 is about one inch longer, really a 35/36 and more on the 36"" length",2
"Otherwise a great looking shirt, especially for the price",1
Fit perfectly and made with quality material,1
These shirts are the best dress shirts for work,1
I bought 10 of them,1
They don?t cost that much so you can buy plenty and not worry about throwing one away if you stained it,1
Very nice quality dress shirt,1
Goes with Levi?s and or slacks and fits very nice with a vest and tie,1
Perfect fit after measuring,1
The shirt did not leave much room and I had to order a size larger than normal and it still did,0
This is a great shirt for the price,1
Needed them for funeral,0
color was what we needed,1
Like,1
For me,1
I love being able to get a shirt with a choice of sleeve length as I have short arms,0
I'm a 17,0
"5 "" neck and only 5'9"" tall so usually end up with shirts tailored for a gorilla",0
These shirts fit,1
Are well made summer weight shirts,0
I usually pay twice the price at M&amp,0
"S, and the sleeves never fit",0
I have all 4 choices for this reason and wish they did more,0
Very good quality shirt,1
Paul,0
Really good fit,1
Fits round my stomach nicely which not all shirts do,1
Arms fit well and are of a generous fit,1
Nice finish hopefully will wear well,1
I am long in the body so 37??sleeve gives you a much longer shirt to fit in the waist,0
Great fit and great material and very smart collar,1
"Very happy , i have the set ie 4 shirts",1
Recommend,1
Fits well and feels comfy,1
Nice looking well made shirt,1
Washes well and dries fairly crease free,1
I hate ironing,0
Few minutes in tumble dryer on decrease setting and it?s ready to wear again,1
Very Good Quality and Very Good Presentation,1
I feel very well with it,1
I will buy some more,1
Love this shirt very nice quality and a good fit looked very smart sadly it was ordered for a funeral,1
The sleeves on this shirt were really short and the fit on the body was boxy,2
Not sure who this would actually fit,2
The shirt looks very good,1
It is to be sent as a present so can't say how it fits yet,0
Great value for money,1
Great fit,1
Washes well,1
Looks very nice on too,1
Bought for my dad,0
They're his favourite shirts,1
good material good value great thank you,1
Good fit round my larger body,1
"OMG, what a brilliant quality/ fit shirt for knocking around in",1
You could easily wear it with a suit and tie if you don?t mind a single cuff,1
Well made,1
Smaller than a 4x should be,2
Tight round chest,2
My other 4x fits fine,0
Beautiful blue shirt ?,1
Greatly value for money and a perfect fit,1
Quality,1
Excellent fit,1
And goes with my suit,1
Smooth and comfy,1
Haven?t wished it yet so don?t know post wash condition,0
I'm not sure what others are complaining about regarding the sizing,0
"It fits my fat belly perfectly well, and I received exactly what i was expecting",1
Neck size 18,0
5 matches up very well with other shirts I have of that size,1
More than enough room in the body,1
This is not slim-fit at all,1
Certainly nothing to complain about for the price,1
We'll see how well and long it lasts,0
"Any better than 6 months and I'd say it's worth the money, though I'd rather spend more for something that will last longer",0
Only complaint is that there are little plastic bits in the collar to keep it pointed,2
"My collar only had one of these in place, as the little pocket for them is left open on one end",2
Must have fallen out somewhere along the way,2
These shirts are a really good deal,1
"They fit as expected, though they're a little long",0
"Shouldn't pose a problem, though",0
"Material is nice, will probably work well in the warmer weather",1
"It looks sharp, will do very nicely for the office",1
Wish there was some way to be notified when the other colours I want in my size come back in stock,0
This product appears and feels on the cheap side,1
"If Amazon Essentials were to come out with a premium line, that likely would be better",0
"Would I purchase again, no",2
I have not tried other AE clothing products and not sure I would further,2
My wrinkle free non iron shirt arrived rolled up in a ball in a very small bag,2
see photo,0
Terrible packaging by amazon had to pay $5 for dry cleaning to get all the wrinkles out,2
So much for wrinkle free,2
Very nice shirt,1
The colour of the real thing is darker than the picture and looks better in real thing,2
"Also, it was not as wrinkle free as I had hoped and collar absorbs neck skin oil very quickly",2
I AM USED TO BUYING SHIRTS BY LARGE XLARGE OR XXLARGE - FOUND IT VERY HARD TO BUY BY NECK SIZE TO HAD TO RETURN AS IT TURNED OUT TO ONLY A SMALL SIZE,2
Love it,1
I like that fact that I can choose a shorter sleeve,1
I wear medium size shirt from local store,0
Usually the sleeves are too long,0
Very excellent well priced shirt,1
Doesn't shrink,1
Perfect size,1
Nice clean business casual shirt,1
Collar doesn't curl up after wash,1
So  I will repeat purchases,1
At the price point that this shirt sells at I give it a pass though,1
Es una camisa 100% algodÃ³n de muy buena calidad,1
Great shirt winklefree after wash,1
Tailored well with stiffness around neck and wrists as expected,1
fabric is very thin and translucent [see through],2
Not a problem for me as I keep my coat on when visiting clients,0
Great,1
Too small,2
Perfect and have done 2 washes,1
has kept up,1
I feel the sleeves are about a inch short,2
A+,1
A little tight in the chest given the neck and sleeve size,2
Good price,1
Overall a nice shirt,1
Fits as expected and washes wrinkle free,1
Wife is happy,1
"Consegna perfetta, camicia elegante, buon cotone",1
Parfait selon monchoixo,1
"Fit is perfect, material is perfect",1
"Good quality, perfect fit, great price",1
I am very happy with this purchase,1
This is one of the best clothing items I've ordered on Amazon,1
Good value for the price,1
nice shirt,1
Passt wie erwartet,1
Two shirts ordered fit well,1
Two did not fit at all,2
"Semble de bonne qualitÃ©, col avec baleines ce qui n'est plus courant",1
Taille bien,1
A voir la tenue dans le temps aprÃ¨s lavages,0
"NÃ©anmoins le ""Guide des tailles"" Amazon n'est pas claire",2

Great value,1

The right cuff buttons are just a tad off so the cuff hem doesn't match exactly,2
"I really like the collar on these, after buttoning them down they hold their shape well and look good with a sweater or jacket",1
"The buttons are top quality, well sewn, and the fit was exactly as expected",1
"I have a V shape and prefer button-down collar, tapered fit shirts",0
Getting difficult to find tailored fit button-down collar dress shirts that don't look cheap,2
I couldn't button the cuffs,2
The left button on the collar fell off before the end of the day,2
Would be A+ if it had a button down collar,0
"After the second laundering, a buttonhole on the front frayed and is now essentially unusable",2
Need to add another button to the bottom of the shirt to help keep it straight when tucked in your pants,2
Buttons loose,2
One of the collar buttons was missing when it arrived,2
"This top of the line button down collar shirt has that tailored look and feel, one of Van Heusen's best",0
Other than that this is my third button down Van Heusens shirt,0
Button holes on sleeves are not present,2
"Decent office shirt for everyday-type use, has held up well over a few months - color is still sharp and we have seen no problems with loose stitching, buttons coming off or badly sewn button-holes etc etc - quality appears to be consistently high",1
I may try to reorder the same shirt and watch closer what button I push,2
Dad can button his neck again :,2
One star taken away for a poorly made buttonhole,2
I cannot button the neck,2
"Perfect fit, not many long sleeve button shirts fit this nicely",1
The right sleeve is about 34 inches and the left is too short to even button,2
"this particular material holds hair, lint and dust pretty bad however",2
This button down/dress shirt is very poor quality,2
"The button holes and the buttons did not line up properly, so there was a bulge of extra fabric at the top below the collar",2
"If you find this review helpful, please don't forget click on the ""Helpful"" button",0
"It does not have a placket down the front of the shirt where the buttonholes are located, which to us makes this shirt look a little more casual",0
"Either way this is a very sharp shirt you can wear with a tie to dress it up, or a few buttons down without the tie, maybe even untucked if you wish",0
*If this review helped you make an informed choice about this product in any way I would appreciate it if you take a moment of your time and let me know by hitting the Helpful button and letting me know,0
The stitching around the cuffs and buttons were well stitched,1
Other shirts I've bought have shrunk when dry cleaned making them very difficult to button the top button to wear a tie,0
Buttons are tight,2
The first one the top button was not aligned properly and the second one the cuffs was cut way to small,2
"The Van Huesen shirt fit fine, this one I could not even button",2
I really like how easy it is to button the neck button because I had a mild stroke five years ago that affected my left hand a bit,1
Have been buying Amazon essentials white shirts for a while,0
Recently started noticing that the shirt buttons are cracking or cracked,2
"This shirt works great as a basic, button down, dress shirt for men",1
When with a sweater it looks great and can leave a button undone if needed,1
I would give it 4 stars if amazon created an amazon essentials dress shirt with a button down collar,0
Nice button down dress shirts,1
Two buttons on sleeves for comfort,0
must write a rave review because guys gain weight in their gut not butt-thank you for a shirt that looks good on a big guy,1
Buttons are sewn on well and the shirt is comfortable,1
Not bad for a budget but,1
Buttons dont sit well,2
I couldn't even button it,2
Wear a lot of button ups and they can be expensive,0
The top button must always be fastened or you will look slovenly,0
"- Sleeve cuff is single button, 2 position",0
The sleeves have dual buttons to accommodate your wrist size or watch  and the  sleeve placket also has a button,0
Extra buttons are sewn inside the bottom of the front packet to replace any that might come off over time,0
"The shirt is well made-buttons sewn on properly, cuffs stitched nicely and the collar lies flat",1
"Otherwise, though, the shirt has everything I like -- a chest pocket, spread collar with slots for stays, two spare buttons attached to the hem, a good long hem, etc",1
The shirt is long sleeve and is a button up design,0
"The hem is rounded, with a double pleat in back, rounded single button cuffs, a chest pocket and spread collar",0
Small imperfections like extra string hanging off some buttons,2
"A shame, as the check pattern is perfect, the construction is sound, and the buttons are neatly and tightly sewn on",1
The collar does not button down,2
A white button down shirt is a staple in the wardrobe of many men,1
"They also tend to have a bottom button that is placed annoying ""high"" leaving the tent flaps wide open on the bottom, this shirt is no exception",2
"And, although it can't be seen clearly in the photo, there is no placket down the button line",2
A placket is a double layering of fabric that hold the buttons and buttonholes,2
"They do look great,  however",1
A few weeks back my husband shopped locally for a long-sleeved blue button down dress shirt,0
"We both are thrilled with these shirts and highly recommend them for quality, comfort and all the great attributes described",1
The last button also lies at my belly button,2
", this is a problem as the shirt will be divided below the button and have a hard time staying tucked all day",2
"As a mom who sews extensively, I appreciated the lovely buttons on the shirt",1
Buttons are stitched on well and won't fall off,1
I tend to wear my pants right below the belly button so I am not normally in danger of having the shirt come up out of the pants,0
I wish these shirts had the strip down the front where the shirts button,0
I really don't like the plain flat front because that strip holds the shirt in place and the buttons don't pull against the material,2
This shirt does not have a seam on both sides of the buttons,0
"I washed it before it was worn and when I was ironing it, I noticed black around each button on the inside of the material, along with the pocket",2
"Didn't want too may buttons, needed white dress shirts",2
THEY WOULDN'T EVEN BUTTON UP THE FRONT,2
The buttoned collar fits very well around the knot of the tie,1
There is only one negative to these shirts and that is the color of thread used for the buttons,0
"This is only a problem because I wear the shirts with the top button unbuttoned, the off color thread on the back of the top button is very visible as it does not blend well with the color of the shirt",2
Threads were hanging off of them all over and the buttons are sewn on with white thread on dark navy shirt,0
Cannot look at watch without unbuttoning wrists,2
"This was confirmed for me in that the buttons were done up on only one of the sleeves, as if someone had tried it on",0
There was a cut/tear buy the buttons on the front of the shirt about 1-1 1/2 inches long,0
"It takes me 10 mins to remove a tag from the collar, chest, button",2
"Its very good quality,stayed fesh all this while",1
Is this an error on my shirt or does everyone have these yellowed buttons?  I really was disappointed that the buttons did not more closely match the fabric,2
Wish manufacture added one more button at the bottom for a nicer length fit,0
Shirt opens up around the waist area that could be corrected with an additional button,0
I am 6????and the buttons end above my bellybutton,0
Stitching and button fold are all different too,2
"These are good quality shirts - not a lot of hanging threads, also they don't wrinkle excessively and I think they will probably last quite a while",1
This is important if you plan on buttoning the top button and wearing a tie,0
Even with the top button done and a tie on I felt like I was wearing an open neck shirt,0
"The position of the buttons are not exactly on the same spot, especially on the cuffs",0
Needed a plain white button down,0
"The neck doesn't even button because it's so tight, though the rest of the shirt was the same fit as the other one I bought, which was true to size",2
"Nice spread collar that behaves itself under a sport coat, even when unbuttoned on top/no tie",0
The collar forces ones ties down the way it is designed at the button top,0
"Left cuff only has one button, the other one is missing",0
Van Heusen fitted poplin button down shirts,0
"first, they added gauntlet buttons, which was a very good idea, and their previous absence was rather strange",0
Needed a simple button shirt for work,0
The stitches on the button holes have untrimmed threads just hanging out of them,0
Also they saved money by not sewing the front of the shirt down where it buttons,0
I will say that the material does feel a bit tough and I do see some of the threads come a bit loose around the buttons after just one wash,0
"These shirts still have pockets, and you can buy them in a size that actually fits you so your face doesn't turn blue when you button the top button and put on a tie",0
Consequently it is hard to find a fitted shirt that I can button at the top to wear a tie,0
"I also have some IZOD size XL button up shirts that are supposedly 18"" necks that I can button fine",0
"If wearing a tie and collar fully buttoned, material may be a bit scratchy on skin",0
See pic I took of area where collar buttons,0
BUT,0
"The collar is a classic style, no buttons, and remained stiff throughout the evening that I wore it",0
It???a nice simple button down,0
"All in all, a perfectly average button down",0
none of the buttons ever fell off and its STILL good,0
"And, it didn't just fall off, the whole center portion of the button broke out, so I couldn't sew it back on",0
"Plus, there are no spare buttons on the inside like you get with a quality shirt",0
"This one was not just too tight, I couldn't even button it",2
It??梨?be better if they don???put a tag on the buttons,0
I pretty much wear just these for my button-ups,0
"They are sharp enough for a professional look, yet easy to unbutton the top and roll up the sleeves for a more casual setting",0
Nice shirt - fits as expected and has two sets of buttons on the cuffs for a nice secure feel,0
It is very hard to button and unbutton the top button,0
I loved the shirt but,0
Good stitching nice buttons,0
"No excessive loose fibers, the buttons are fixed, everything is good",0
except that 3 buttons have or are falling off,0
The 4th button down in the chest is gone,0
"One on the sleeve will likely fall off very soon, as will another button along the chest",0
"Not sure if these are just not tightly-wound buttons, or an issue with the tightening down of these buttons, or a sign of things to come with the shirt",0
"It would be a perfect, inexpensive button up shirt if it was just a little longer",0
A button on the cuff broke on the first day of use,0
5 for comfort otherwise leave the neck unbuttoned and slide the tie up,0
Keep in mind that the fabric is a bit thin and the buttons are on the verge of looking cheap,0
"He has to wear a white button up, with his suit, to work everday",0
Bought my size compared to all of my other button downs,0
affordable white shirts for awhile,0
This shirt is the same size as all of my other button up shirts from other brands and it is MUCH smaller,0
"The lowest button on this shirt is still above the belt line, and it comes untucked constantly",0
"If you like the cut of less trendy button downs, this is a well made shirt",1
The only company that puts black buttons on a black shirt,0
As context I've just discovered the phenomenon of less blousy button front shirts for men,0
"It does fit well and look good, however",1
He didn't want a button down shirt because they never fit right,0
I wish the buttons were dark grey or lavender,0
"Fits perfectly, haven't bought new shirts for work for a while",1
He wore it even though it arrived with a broken button and no spare button,2
The top button broke in the wash the first time that the shirt was washed,2
The point collar is stylish and the buttons are easy to button up,1
"The position of the buttons are not exactly on the same spot, especially on the cuffs",2
I?셫 a 3x and I couldn?셳 even button it,2
Order the exact same size of the same brand I bought in a retail store and it barely buttoned up,2
button is almost impossible to fasten and unfasten when the shirt has been drycleaned and starched,2
I spend a lot of effort getting the top button through the buttonhole,2
"Wider shoulders , slimmer waist and durable buttons",1
"Instead, I can barely button it over my chest and waist, with the buttons straining to pop open",2
Missing cuff button,2
"The collar is not one of those new ""skimp on the collar material"" wide, it is pointed, and no buttons",0
The only suggestion I could make to Van Heusen would be to add stitching down the strip where the buttonholes are so the material doesn't fold underneath the buttonholes when they're washed,0
Quality isn't necessarily bad for price however,0
"Shirt had broken button and no spares attached to shirt, otherwise fit and look fine",0
Has a pocket and no collar buttons,0
I have to wear white button ups for my job,0
Good quality fabric and buttons,0
First time I wear a black button shirt,0
One was missing buttons,0
"a generic, white, button up shirt to wear with colorful ties and blazers",0
The first time I wore it I had to take out a pair of scissors and cut many loose threads around the sleeves and buttons,0
"The buttons also seem to be loosely attached to the shirt, time will tell if these fall off from normal use or not",0
These shirts fit perfectly and have two button sleeves he prefers,0
"Comfortable with top button secured, looks",0
"lots of loose threads, around buttons and wrist",0
"5 star product if one more button is added to the bottom, the last button at the bottom is a little high which makes it weird to tuck in sometimes",0
The collar was sharp and buttoned up nicely,0
Button on the sleeves was sown on backwards,0
Was missing a button on the sleeve,2
One of the buttons popped off when I tried to wear the shirt for the first time,2
last a while,0
Van Heusen are my go to for button ups,1
Buttons fell off and seams ripped,2
"* the buttons would likely be nicer if color-matched instead of ""off-white""",2
"I can actually close the neck button with a tie, fits properly at shoulders and tapers nicely at waist",1
I end up un buttoning them and rolling the sleeves up,0
Second button from top too low makes neck opening too large too low when only neck button is undone,2
Chest size was good however,1
Really like the color options and the buttons are a slightly unusual pattern that helps it stick out,1
Both types come with extra buttons that match,0
I'll wear it with an undershirt since doing up the buttons means my lower back looks all puffy,0
"which is good, some long sleeve button-ups are thick and make me sweat easily",1
It is a bit thicker than your typical button up which is nice and is a true medium,1
I recheck it but,0
I have a bit of a beer belly so if I bought the medium I probably would be testing the tensile strength of the button thread and looking ridiculous,0
I couldn't even button it past the 3rd button,2
"If you are a slimmer guy like myself, this is not a business-casual button-up",2
Wore the shirt one time and two buttons broke from normal unbuttoning and buttoning of the shirt,2
Bottom button broke off when putting the shirt on the middle button broke off when taking it off,2
If it weren?셳 for the cheap buttoning the shirt would be amazing,2
It seems as if it was just thrown together on a sewing machine and strands of fabric are noticeable along the stitching and button inserts,2
Super cute button up,1
"Ordered a 4X and when I tried it on still had 6"" before it would button",0
A button was missing from the sleeve of the shirt when it arrived and was found loose in the bag,2
"Buttons are awesome, and the pocket is not real",1
3X and cant even button it,2
It not tight or super loose like some button shirts can be,0
And all the buttons fell off on the first wash,2
I ordered a size larger than we actually needed and the button down shirt came about 3 sizes smaller,2
plus the shirt button quality is very poor,2
Side note- VERY cute buttons,1
The Buttons  Watsons are low Quality,2
"Also vendor must be meaning ""child"" size as I bought a XL and I could barely fit my arms in the sleeves let alone button up the shirt",2
"The first time I washed it, a button came off",2
"Thankfully, I found the button in the wash tank",0
I like that the buttons are plastic and not metal - plastic will not scratch the back of my guitar,1
"I wear a 2x just to be sure there not be a problem i ordered a 3 x ,which cannot be buttoned up",2
Second to top button in the picture is not in the same position on actual shirt causing me to look either have open like Fabio or buttoned up and I should be wearing a tie,0
Cuffs don't have an inside button to make it easy to button the cuffs up,2
After wearing I rip at least 2 stitches attempting to unbutton the shirt,2
Buttons are spaced too far apart,2
the buttons are cool and wood-like,1
I suspect the machine that folded the shirt shaved some of the buttons in half,0
"""Wrinkle free"" is a joke",0
see picture,0
"That is the shirt fresh out of a still tumbling, hot dryer, immediately put on a hanger",0
There's also threads coming loose all over the place,2
again: pictures,0
"There's one more thing, and I'm seeing it more and more in shirts, and it bugs me: they have those plastic collar-stays that are a PART OF THE SHIRT",0
"This means that they will eventually become old and deformed, and that's how your collar is going to look for the rest of the shirt's life",2
There's no way to get them out without cutting them out,2
"If you need an absolutely mediocre shirt, this is the shirt for you",1
This shirt had been worn and washed,0
It had no tags and a dryer sheet in it still,2
How can you ship an item without any tags? How can you ship a dress shirt balled up and stuffed in a small bag? This really is unbelievable,2
"So, I have a long and tedious history trying to find a simple white dress shirt that ""fits me""",1
"Being overweight as I am the real solution is to put down the donuts and drop down to a healthy size, until then I need a shirt that can ""cover"" me",0
This shirt was close as I said,0
regardless of the cardboard/burlap collar,0
"I work in an office that requires me to wear a long sleeved collared shirt,in a place with warm weather",0
"I don't dress to impress, I just want a basic fuss-free shirt, and this one is perfect, especially if you don't want to wear white every day",0
The fabric is fairly thin,0
poplin,0
"and not very soft, so I don't wear it directly on the skin, I always wear a cotton crew t-shirt underneath",2
"The fabric does feel better though, than what you would expect from only 35% cotton",0
"The fit is relaxed and comfortable, definitely not tight or fitted - Van Heusen do make a fitted version of this shirt as well",1
If you are looking for a slim fit - this will probably be a little large,0
"Machine washed this many times with no issue, easy to iron as expected from a poplin shirt",1
Another reason to like Van Heusen is that they make a 15,0
"5"" neck with 36""-37"" sleeves - a combination that is not available from many shirt makers - I'm 6'3"" and under 200 pounds so I need a fitted shirt with long enough sleeves",0
At under $20 this is great value,1
At $12-$13 it's an absolute steal,0
This shirt is made in Honduras,0
Definitely doesn't compare to a heavier broadcloth or oxford cloth,0
"I think this is important on a dress shirt, since it provides a cleaner look when starched and adds strength",1
"And adds cost, of course",1
Next we'll see how it launders,0
"Anyway, I'd recommend a shirt with a placket for the best looks and long lasting strength, especially if commercially laundered",1
An outstanding value considering the costs of men's dress shirts these days,1
It is a genuine VH and fits accordingly,1
The size chart is accurate to the shirt sizes so feel confident the fit will be good if you buy according to the size chart,0
It is truly wrinkle-resistant out of the dryer,1
Just dry it on a cool cycle and shake it and hang it,0
After an hour on the hanger you can wear the shirt as if it were commercially laundered,0
The collar and cuffs hold their shape,1
My guess is you won't find a genuine VH shirt at this price in a brick &amp,0
mortar store or even at other online stores,0
I am so pleased with the quality and fit of this white dress shirt,1
that I plan to buy more from this vendor,0
My husband wore this shirt with his suit to walk our daughter done the aisle,0
No need to pay a lot to get a nice basic white shirt,2
Nice looking shirt that says WRINKLE FREE,1
It is NOT,0
Not even close,0
I tried steaming it  Didn't work,0
So washed it on quick cycle and dried,0
Very wrinkled,2
Put in dryer on touch up,0
Still wrinkled,2
Ironed it  with steam iron took forever to get the wrinkles out,0
Finally got it to look ok for the wedding my husband is in,0
That is the only negative,2
That's why 3 star,0
Too bad cuz it is a nice shirt,0
I have to say,0
"for the price, it was a good purchase",1
I bought it solely for the purpose of wearing to a wedding with my first ever suit,0
"I cheated and tried the shirt on at a JC Penny before buying it on Amazon, because this is the first dress shirt I?셶e worn in two decades",0
I?셫 happy with my purchase,1
"As stated in other reviews, the fabric is thin, which is appropriate for the warm climate that I live in",0
I am going to wear an undershirt anyhow,0
to absorb sweat if necessary,0
", so the thinness of the fabric isn't an issue",0
It should be good enough for a not so formal professional environment,0
"I you are expected to occasionally roll up your sleeves and do some messy physical work, having an inexpensive shirt like this on is nice, so you don't worry about messing up a really expensive piece of clothing",0
"I needed a full cut, wrinkle-free shirt that was not too expensive",0
These fit the bill,0
I have ordered them repeatedly,1
They definitely need it after even one wearing,2
"I have found that dryer sheets leave marks on them, so I can't use the sheets when I dry them",2
These are not expensive shirts,0
"For example, they stain easily",1
I noticed that the neck size for my most recent order seems a bit larger than prior orders,2
Feels like cheap plastic,2
"And this is the #1 best seller? And who is it that says what is popular is good? Wrong, its more like poopular",1
"The color as black is very good,",1
"Size was overall good, maybe a touch short for some, as myself",1
If you want to feel cheap plastic and you like to sweat and get hot,2
maybe this is the shirt for you,1
"I got multiple choice questions when selecting to write a review,  to rate the features",0
"On another Amazon shirt, it asked how the length was, if below belt, or more",0
"On this they as neck, waist, chest, and overall",0
"They left the length out, AND it happens to be the part that I think is a bit short",0
"I like wearing my dress shirt untucked, out, sometimes, and this length is a bit short for that look",2
"This shirt came with 5 or 6 pins I HATE needing to remove, AND it was wrinkled fold, and it felt like cheap plastic",2
It says wrinkle free,0
NOPE,0
You get the wrinkles that will have a hard time coming out,2
RETURNING,2
THIS is a #1 best seller? I feel sorry for people who encourage trash with hard earned money,2
Sheep masses is identified for a reason,0
I should have read the information better,0
I thought it was going to be 65/35% cotton/polyester,0
It was the reverse,0
My shirts have always been 100% cotton so I'm not crazy about this,0
I chose these because of the quality brand and that it has become almost impossible to find a point collar,0
nice that you get the option of point or spread,1
I ordered a half-size larger and am glad I did,1
"Hopefully, all that artificial fabric won't shrink up like the cotton",0
I ordered two white shirts and one in Leaf Green,0
The green shirt arrived a couple of days ahead of the white and was literally wadded up and stuffed in a plastic bag,2
I hope I can iron out all the deep wrinkles,2
"The white ones came later, nicely folded and packaged",0
Maybe two different sellers?  X-posting on the green shirt review,0
Eight months later:,0
The shirts survive the laundry well and the collar still holds it shape and the neck shrunk less in size than 100% cotton would,1
Feels good and wears well,1
The point collar makes all the difference to me,1
So I decided to re-order a couple more,1
This $20 shirt I bought 8 months ago is now $35,0
WTH?  Pass,0
I used to buy Van Heusen dress shirts like this one,0
"Then my wife had me try Stafford shirts, and I was impressed",1
I only need 2 or 3 at the most because I only wear them for church and special occasions when I need to wear a suit,0
"As the last shirts began to wear, I saw an ad on Amazon for this shirt and so decided to try one again",0
I'm very disappointed,2
"First, the thread count, or thread quality, is very low",2
"The shirt is much thinner than the Stafford shirts, even though those are now old and worn",2
Also I only buy 65% polyester because they are so much easier to keep free of wrinkles,0
This Van Heusen dress shirt is pathetic,0
It's always wrinkled,2
That's not true of the Stafford shirts,2
I guess I need to pay a few more bucks for Stafford and totally give up on Van Heusen,2
"The quote I heard years ago is true: ""The bitterness of poor quality lasts long after the sweetness of low price is forgotten",2
Shirt was advertised as wrinkle resistant,0
I washed it once in cold water on the gentle cycle and the collar is ruined,2
Permanently wrinkled?봊 can?셳 even iron it out,2
The material feels very cheap and thin,2
"The fit in the armpit is too snug, it limits range of motion",2
"The fit through the waist is also poor and the fabric is cut in a way that either looks stretched, or crumpled depending on my posture",2
There is no position where it looks good or well fitted,2
He was lucky to find two shirts that fit the need,1
"I searched on Amazon and found a shirt that was the same size, color, and wrinkle free, etc",0
These Van Heusen shirts wash and dry perfectly-no touch up needed,1
"Also, hard to describe this",2
No,0
"Purchased a size 17 based on the size chart for the shirt which stated a 17 would have a 53"" chest and a 51"" waist",0
Should have been plenty roomy,0
"Instead the 17 fit like a fitted shirt with a 44"" chest and a 42"" waist",0
WAY TOO SMALL,2
Totally disappointed in the accuracy of the description,2
I have been having difficulties with the consistency in sizes from shirts ordered online,2
I really needed some good dress shirts so I found one of my old Van Heusen shirts and reordered a few,1
This is a green shirt which is also hard to find in local stores,0
I was pleasantly surprised,1
Other than the 'Regular' fit being large in the waist area the shirt fits nice and I got compliments on it right away,0
Very happy with it,1
I read reviews that said there was no Placket,2
That's not true,0
At least with mine,0
I recommend it,1
Edited on Jan 28th 2020:,0
"I ordered another one of these, again the size fits perfectly and the color is great",1
The only inconsistency is the material,2
The material was very stiff,0
Not soft at all,2
After washing it was better,0
I may run it through a few times the next time,2
Still recommend them,1
As someone with a gut,0
Typical American dad bod,0
"Unfortunately, I have to bear the burden of the shirt for a wedding tomorrow as this was a last minute order",2
Buyer beware,0
16-32/33,0
"is apparently meant for people who are 5'5""-5'6""",0
Loved that this shirt came in so many neck sizes and sleeve lengths,1
It is very well made,1
The tie is from JEMYGINS Christmas Ties for Men ordered from Amazon as well and just as wonderful,0
See review,0
Shipment is extremely fast from Amazon,1
Really appreciate that,1
like a grayish black,0
since I compared it with Amazon Essentials black dress shirt,0
Not stretchable and quite tight in some areas especially if you are big and tall,0
It shrunked after 1 wash,2
Lesson learned,2
I will stick to Amazon Essentials dress shirt which is a little bit stretchable and true to size,0
"After I had worn the dress shirt for the first time, my wife elected to do something we don't usually do with my dress shirts",2
She washed and dried it in a washer/dryer because we were on the road and couldn't use our regular dry cleaners,2
"After a dryer cycle, one dryer cycle, the shirt began to fray",0
"It reminded me of when I used to buy shirts at places like K-Mart--only when I compared the wear and tear of those cheap shirts versus PVH shirts, the latter used to win",2
"Now, my wife doesn't want me to buy anything other than Brooks Brothers dress shirts",1
I have become fed up with shirts that fit too tight,2
I want to look good and be comfortable,1
The market is flooded with slim and tailored fit shirts and regular sized fellas like me have a hard time finding 'normal' shirts,2
These shirts are exactly what I like:,0
"Comfortable fit with ample room in shoulders, arm, and chest without looking baggy",1
They stay tucked in,0
Collar tabs stitched in so they don't fall out,0
Easy to wash and come out generally wrinkle free,1
Easy to iron,1
Affordable,1
I have purchased approximately ten of these shirts in different colors and I am pleased with each and every one of them,1
I purchased this shirt because I am a tall woman,0
190cm,0
and can never find women's shirts that are long enough,0
"I ordered the 36"" length",0
", the body of the shirt is not any longer than a regular",0
not tall,0
shirt,0
"I have bought tall shirts in the past and they have a corresponding increase in the length of the torso/body, this one just seems strange that it doesn't have that, otherwise it is a nice shirt",0
I bought three of these to put into my dress shirt rotation and the amount of loose string is not to be believed,2
"I took all 3 out of the bags, washed them once on a gentle cycle and then ironed",0
and not the kind of loose ends that just pull out because it's extra thread run off from the sowing machine,2
These are just low quality loose ends that are actually needed to hold the fabric together and in place,2
I feel like it would take a miracle for these to last even a few more wash cycles before completely falling apart at the seams,2
These would be good for a food serving job if you just needed shirts to last a few months and don't care if they got stained,0
"NOT Wrinkle Free, NOT fabric",2
"It comes out in a wrinkled mess from the packaging, you need to steam iron it, fluffing it in the dryer does virtually nothing and the fabric is this weird plastic material that feels like it's 3/4 the material a pool raft is made out of and is very uncomfortable",2
"If you're looking for something that dries quickly and you're walking through the rainforest I would expect it to be awesome, I work in a business office and if I wore this people would make fun of me",0
"If you're looking for a professional-looking wrinkle-free business shirt this is not it, there are far better options out there",0
I I was surprised I usually have a lot of respect for this brand,1
i ordered two of these shirts for my son,0
"I had to google how to find the measurements, and it was from a different manufacturer so I don't know if Van Hausen uses the same rules",0
"I measured my son's neck at 17 inches and the website said to add half an inch, so I did",0
"His back to wrist measure is 34""",0
"Therefore, I ordered 2 17",0
"5"" x 34-35"" shirt",0
This is part of the problem with buying over the internet,2
not being able to try things on,0
"Perhaps this is just a problem with having long arms because he's 5'10"" and 175#",2
I thought Van Heusen meant quality,1
probably entirely because of all the Van Heusen marketing materials I saw when I was a younger and more gullible person,1
"Either that or, as with so much else, Van Heusen *used* to mean quality and now just means",0
nothing of any importance,0
"Life's too short, and I'm too old and too well-paid, to wear cheap, stiff, rough-textured shirts",0
"I think the fit's alright, though I haven't worn one of these long enough to really pay attention to that",1
I feel that fabric against my skin and all I think of is getting the shirt off me as quickly as possible,2
And all -- except for one cardboard backer -- is headed for the landfill,2
I have spent less time unassembling the plumbing under a sink,0
I ordered 4 shirts of this brand in different colors with a size 18 neck,2
This is my husband's neck size,0
We typically have to order by the neck size and have the body tailored because he has broad shoulders and a muscular frame,0
They were all labeled 18,0
I measured it and it was 17,0
We did not open the other 3 shirts and returned all,2
I know you are thinking as I did:  did he put on weight?  He did a little,0
Other brand shirts with an 18 neck fit just fine and I did measure his neck with a tape measure,0
This shirt does have a nice price point and the construction seemed solid,1
I do recommend you order up in neck size though,1
"When I put the white shirt into my shopping cart, I changed my order from one to two",0
At Christmas my husband tried on one of the shirts &amp,0
"it fit him perfectly, so he opened both of them thinking they'd be the same WRONG",1
When he grabbed the 2nd shirt to wear the sleeves were too short,0
We thought that's strange &amp,2
"wondered if we were just mistaken when he tried the first one on, so we lined up the shoulders of both shirts &amp",0
sure enough one sleeve was 2 inches shorter than the other shirt,0
"I'd buy with care, good luck",1
"For the price, this is best ever",1
Bought the black ones and husband loves it,1
Fabric is suitable for the Midwestern climate,1
So,0
be realistic guys,0
100% wrinkle free cost 4 times more and you already earn more than you pay already,1
"After a test drive and a few washes, husband asked me to order 2 more right away",1
This is an exceedingly lousy shirt,0
We have purchased Van Heusen in the store before,0
similar price,0
I was hoping this would be the same shirt,0
It's a piece of junk,2
"It's about the same quality as the little boy shirts you get in a Christmas/Easter set at Walmart, if not worse",0
I've ordered about 8 of these shirts over the last year,0
Honestly it's hit or miss,0
The manufacturer seems to have serious QA issues,0
One shirt had a black thread in between the back layers,0
which showed through the white main material,0
",  another had a greasy black smudge on the back, a third inexplicably had sleeves that were two inches shorter than all the others of the same sleeve length",0
despite what the size tag said,0
", and a forth had a an unever collar that was stitched all wrong",0
"Oh yeah, they are not very wrinkle free either",2
"This fit great and exactly as expected, only thing is- I bought this because it was the perfect shade of red for family photos we would be doing in just two dayswhen it arrived the day before photos it was plad which I couldn't tell by the picture or the color name which was a little frustrating",1
"Because this can be deceving if you have other expectations, I gave the shirt only 4 stars",0
Pictures worked out in the end in case your wondering,0
I am a full bodied man  so I find the loose fit of this shirt perfect for a larger person,2
If I were a slim person I probably would opt for a fitted or classic type shirt,0
I also live in the South were hot weather is a norm so I find the thin material appropriate for this area,1
and when I look at the price of other shirts in my local stores I find this shirt a good bargain,0
"Those who want a shirt with thicker material or better fit should investigate what the terms ""regular fit"", ""Fitted"" or ""classic",0
""" means before a purchase is made",0
and as for price we all know you pay for what you get,0
Don't expect a 20 dollar shirt to be of the same quality of a 40 dollar shirt,2
Ordered too large to fit neck and check area as recommended by measurements,2
Ended up with like a xxl,2
Rating does not represent the quality at all,0
"For me, dress shirts are hard find the right fit unless tried on",2
"Good quality shirt, just didn't fit",0
Had to return,2
I bought this for my fiance to wear to our tiny wedding and it's perfect,1
"He is 6' 9"" and weighs around 230 lbs",0
He generally buys size XL shirts for the length even though a large would probably fit him better around the waist,0
The 17,0
"5"" neck, 36""-37""",0
XL,0
was the perfect size,1
The sleeve length and shirt length were great without it looking too big on him,0
"For Christmas, I decided to replace my husband's work wardrobe",0
He's the type that will wear something until it literally falls apart haha,0
"I decided to order one of the 3 pack dress shirts, and I know that Van Heusen is a good brand",0
"He usually wears a medium/large depending on the brand, for shirts",0
I ordered the size 15,0
"5"" 34-35, and it fits him perfectly",1
"The shirts are very soft, and he says that they're not too hot, very breathable",1
We're both happy with this purchase,1
I picked up 3 of these shirts,0
"2 in blue and one in white, and at $17/each they are a steal",0
"If you wear your pants a little lower and have a larger torso, these might come out of the pants for you",0
I recommend these shirts if they are $20 or less,1
"They do the job, are comfortable, and fit nicely",1
Only time will tell me how well they wear,1
I have 3 of these shirts,0
father's day gifts,0
in different colors and I bought this Ocean Mist color because it looked nice,0
"I think all dress shirts should have that reinforcement strip, it's just makes for better quality and a nicer look",2
Just feels better to me,0
Thank you very much,0
"I am 6'0"" and about 155-160 Ibs my size is 15",0
5 in for neck and 32-33 size,0
I took a shot at getting a regular fit when I usually wear slim,0
There is so much fabric that it looks a little big,2
It looks more like a large than a regular,2
It's really just a fabric issue because the length is fine and the neck fits perfect,0
It would be a 4 stars if the shirt wasn't so big and loose,2
I used to buy these all the time in various colors,1
The quality of the material went down quite a bit,2
The collar becomes extremely wrinkled after one wash,2
"You cannot iron out the collar with water and steam, it still remains wrinkled and I suspect that's due to low quality of the material used and or the way the collar was stitched together",2
"I bought 10 of these shirts, 4 out of 10 had these issues",2
The other 6 I didn't open and decided to return,2
"I bought a large for my husband and he is 6'3"" and weighs 180 so he is thinner than the last time I bought a dress shirt",0
The neck was too big and,2
large neck,2
The collar was perfect for that bigger knot,1
I love Van Heusen shirts,1
That is all my husband wants to wear,1
The fabric was smooth,1
and ironed up beautifully,1
"For the price, you can't beat it- just make sure you are ordering the right size",1
I didn't check and that is my fault,1
Kind of a hurry up purchase for me,1
"The shirt was too big around my chest, arms and waist",2
Neck was spot on,2
The next smaller-size down was to to short on the sleeves,2
Recommend getting fitted by the professionals if you want an ideal fit,1
"Van Heusen, along with Geoffrey Beane, forms the basis for my workweek wardrobe",0
"I appreciate that these shirts have a chest pocket, something that other manufacturers have discarded, as well as the fit",1
The collar points hold up well after repeated launderings,2
The non-iron feature of these shirts mean they are very easy to care for,1
I currently have several Van Heusens and Dave Taylors bough several years ago and at a much more reasonable cost,0
So I bought this plain one,0
plain ones show wrinkles a lot more than patterned and textured ones,0
It wasn't available in the lighter blue I need,0
a color which also seems to be unavailable,0
I bought it in a larger size than usual due to recent Asian made purchases coming in too short and too tight,0
"So,, no fault to the mfgr",0
or the vendor or Amazon,0
It is what it is,0
It's wearable although not nearly as attractive as the previous shirts,0
Apparently the makers of this shirt think a 32/33 sleeve length actually means 35/36,0
"I?셶e never seen such long sleeves, it was comical",0
"The whole shirt was huge, and my son is not scrawny",0
This is the exact size dress shirt he has worn before from other manufacturers that fit him perfectly,0
I think that shirt would fit his much older/taller brother,0
Definitely returning it and going with another shirt maker since the sizing is WAY off,2
Too bad because the shirt actually feels like it?셲 nice material and is made well,2
I looked forward to ordering this Van Heusen dress shirt as I own one from long ago and I like it a lot,1
I ordered 16,0
I put this down as poor quality control,2
"Also I found that the material is itchy, different from the original shirt",2
Very disappointed as I had thought Van Heusen shirts had solved my problem,2
Not so,0
I used to buy my husband Van Heusen shirts for their fit and ease of care,0
It was lint from the dryer,2
I should not have to pick lint out of a brand new shirt,0
"I found it is poorly made, as well",2
This shirt was completely off on sizing,2
"It was suppose to be ""Regular Fit"" described in the listing as: Regular fit dress shirts have fuller sleeves, relaxed arm holes, and a generous cut through the chest and waist",0
This fit is similar to a classic or full cut fit,0
Either it was a mislabeled tailored or fitted shirt or the consistency in manufacturing is horrible,2
It was so tight across my back it would have split wide open if I stretched my arms out or bent over,2
The neck and sleeves were fine though,0
Had just received a pinpoint oxford a few weeks ago in the same size and it fit perfect,0
What's the deal here?  A sizing issue has now occurred on 2 of the last 3 Van Heusen shirts ordered,0
I'll be returning this one - what a pain in the you know what,2
It really should be zero stars,2
Really comfortable,1
The fit is perfect and not nearly as baggy as other shirts I?셶e tried,1
I?셫 a pretty big guy and far from athletic,0
Finding a decent shirt is not that easy,2
The only drawback is that the collar stays are sewn in,2
I always bought van huessan and am pleased with these,1
Would purchase again,1
"Not only is this not wrinkle free as advertised, it is easily the most wrinkly shirt I own",2
It's a pain to iron and is wrinkled again 5 minutes after putting on,2
Otherwise a nice looking shirt though and feels comfortable,1
"Nice looking classic collar, not those weird cutaway collars like so many shirts have now",1
"It is baggy, so if you need the extra room it is good",2
If you don't need the extra room go with a slim fit,0
I needed a white dress shirt for Thanksgiving,0
One that the price was reasonable because I always get cranberry sauce on my Thanksgiving shirts,1
"Anyway, I made it through thanksgiving, then my super hot cousin kissed me all over my face when my Wife was in the other room",0
So I got hot pink lipstick all over my shirt,0
"Next thing I know, my Wife and my cousin were smoochin",0
"Anyway, it was a great thanksgiving",0
This is a good shirt if you are looking for an affordable deal,1
"If you want a fancier or higher quality look, it would be worth it to go for a more expensive brand",0
"for my purposes because I'm on a budget, this was a good shirt",0
Add one start to the review if cost is your number one factor,2
This shirt fit me great,1
"It may not be as opaque as some like, so a t-shirt may need to be worn underneath",0
I will be purchasing more of these,1
VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE SHIRTS,2
I TAKE A 2XL SHIRT AND I COULDN'T EVEN GET THEM CLOSED,0
THEY WERE ABOUT 2 INCHES TO SMALL,0
I HAVE LOTS OF VAN HEUSEN SHIRTS THIS SIZE AND THEY FIT JUST FINE,1
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS WITH THESE 4 SHIRTS THAT I HAD TO RETURNED,0
"This Van Heusen fit more like a 15 1/2"" and has no flex as other dress shirts do now",0
"Although the color is a rich crimson which I prefer over a flame or more orange red, I probably will try another style in thre future--probably one with a stretch collar",0
"Almost wrinkle-free, too",1
I purchased this shirt last minute for my fiancee for our wedding,0
We eloped to Tahoe so I didn't think to open the shirt before I packed it considering he is an average size guy and more than likely the shirt would fit just fine,0
"The night before our wedding we opened the shirt only to find three tiny, reddish/brown dots on the brand new white shirt",0
One on the collar,0
"clearly visible, no way to hide it",0
", one on the right shoulder and one on the left shoulder",0
"Like many dress shirts, this shirt came with multiple pins throughout the folds and collar",0
I ordered this shirt for my husband in the size he always wears,0
we both loved everything about the shirt,1
The fabric was beautiful and had a nice crisp feel,1
the only problem was that the neck ran bit small according to the measurement so we had to return for a size larger,2
I have since ordered another in the larger neck size and it is beautiful,1
The colors and fabric texture are stunning and they wash beautifully,1
I needed a black dress shirt in order to wear concert black so I ordered this to have it in time for the event,0
"I?셫 pleased with fit, relative quality, and design",1
"It?셲 regular, not slim fit, which I appreciate",1
I recommend this product if you need a good basic black dress shirt,1
"After my husband paid ten times the amount that this shirt cost for almost the same thing, I tried this shirt from Amazon",0
It looks great,1
I wish he'd gone to Amazon first,0
This shirt fits him great at the neck and has sleeves long enough,1
"He is 6'2"" tall and weighs 210 lbs",0
The shirt is nicely tailored and looks great on him,0
I love the colors available,1
The make was very clean with a good appearance overall,1
I would buy these shirts again,1
I  wear my shirt for Sunday Church Services and always with a tie,0
The fit is indeed perfect,1
"Problem is, the material is thin and is",2
primarily,0
polyester,0
"You can sort of see-through this shirt at least a little, and the polyester tends to become yellow and ""dingy"" looking pretty quickly",0
A slightly heavier pure cotton,0
or at least more than the 35% in this blend,0
would be preferable,0
I ordered approximately,0
of these shirts to have a variety of colors in my wardrobe,0
"After trying on the shirts, I noticed that the tail and front end of the shirts i",0
", at the bottom front and back is very short",0
This product would be ideal if the front of the shirts were 1-2 inches longer,0
"I really like the material for this shirt, and for the price it is very high quality",1
"My only complaint, and it's barely a complaint, is that the shirt is pretty short in the waist",2
It is a dress shirt so it's designed to be tucked in,0
It should be a few inches longer in my opinion,0
"I am a conservative dresser all my life, and this is a conservative shirt",0
"what I would prefer would be a pocket, which it does not have",1
"Also, I am now wise to Van Huesen shirts having notoriously shorter sleeves, so with this one I ordered a 36- 37 sleeve for my 34- 35 arms, and it worked well",0
"In the future I will continue to buy these in different solid colors, just one sleeve length too ""long""",1
Awesome fit,1
"and for those complaining about it, then it's time to hit the gym and get a better body going",2
Period,0
Pretty decent and doable,2
"It doesn't wrinkle as much, which I love, I do recommend it",1
"Van Heusan shirts are great because I know they will always fit the same, not mater the slim trendy trends, the classic look is something I can depend on",1
The downside to this order was the color of the photo is a bit off,0
"I'll keep it, just not what I was looking for",0
The shirts look and feel great,1
"With the stretch collar, I don't feel like i'm being choked",0
"A dress shirt with wrinkles is not really a ""dress"" shirt",0
"Overall, I'm well pleased and will look at these again in the future if I need a replacement or other color",1
Shirt obviously tried on previously,0
Just shoved into the plastic bag,0
Worrisome given we are in a pandemic,0
Shame on the store for allowing anything to leave in this condition,0
These are great for daily work shirts,1
One star knocked off because of two reasons:,0
"- They aren't ""wrinkle free"" I still have to iron after drying to get a crisp look",2
"- The collar stays are not removable, which I'm not used to",2
"So far, so good",1
I?셫 stuck between a just right and slightly tight fit,2
"I wore this for about 4 hours at a work event and it was not too hot, not too thin",2
Just right,1
Good value,1
The shirt fits well and is as advertised,1
"Having purchased Van Heusen many times from brick and mortar stores, I can say with almost certainty that what I received was NOT a Van Heusen products of any grade",0
The material is cheap and not wrinkle free,2
BUYER BEWARE,2
I have been wearing Van Husen shirts for the past 15 years and bought two white shirts few weeks ago for an interview,0
These shirts are not the Van Husen shirts of old,0
The fit and finish is lacking and I had threads coming out at the cuffs,0
Where the cuffs attach to the arms the sewing looks like it was done by a child,0
Not buying these shirts again,2
"I have several Van Heusen shirts, as they are relatively inexpensive, they fit well, and are easier to find in a regular fit, as it seems that companies are wanting to push ""slim fit""",1
I am not a slim fit shirt guy,2
the only complaint I have about the shirt is the material seems thinner than the other shirts I have bought from them,2
"you can't see through it, so it still works",0
Van Heusen is well known for making quality products,0
The shirt fits perfectly at an affordable price,1
It is neither too loose in the neck or too tight in the shoulders and fits perfectly at the wrist,0
A very classic design,1
I have recently recommended their dress shirts to several of my colleagues,1
I love the color and will definitely purchase from Van Heusen in the future,1
"Wear a T-shirt for sure, it?셲 somewhat see thru",0
"Measure your neck carefully, this fabric does not stretch at all",2
Shoulder and sleeves fit as advertised,0
Fabric is comfortable,1
I ordered this shirt for my Husband to wear for our Wedding Ceremony I ordered it in blue in size Large 16 34/35 he is 5?? and  175 lb he said the shirt was Comfortable,1
I had purchased the flex collar at the same time as this shirt,0
"Being a long term fan of Van Heusen shirts for my business needs, I am equally impressed with this shirt as well",0
5 stars for both as it is easy to were both shirts,1
"Comfortable, convenient when cleaning, easy to care for, and classy in appearance",1
They asked me,0
to step up and take control,0
sloppy clothes do not get you that experience,0
Fits very well,1
"Only drawback is the length, which could have been an inch or two longer",0
"Overall, I've found Van Heusen shirts to be very good value for money and highly recommended",1
I actually lost some weight and re-ordered the slim,0
Both are true to size,0
Both are thiner and much more comfortable,1
"I read a few reviews about these being to thin, thats the way all nicer shirts are made nowdays",0
I much prefer this materal,1
My husband has this shirt and several different colors,0
He's very happy with them,1
Only issue is they do need to be ironed after being washed,2
Can't really get away without ironing them,2
Like the color selection and price,0
"Not 100% wrinkle free, even with high efficiency dryer, so little disappointed in that",2
Seems quality of Van Heusen has dropped in past 2 years,0
Still trying to remove the wrinkles tho,2
seems like its been folded into a package forEVER,0
Keeping it because it fits good enough and the color is sharp,1
I'm soaking it overnight to see if that helps remove the wrinkles,2
"Admittedly I have a large 18 in neck and short arms 30 in, no one makes dress shirts to fit me, either the neck is too small or the sleeves are too long",0
and the chest and waist are way too big,0
"Otherwise the quality of the shirt is good, especially for the price",1
"Now I love the material and the way it feels, although I put it was a little tight around the chest, that?셲 on me, this pandemic I have gained a little weight , and at least I can slim down to that size, wish me luck",1
Perfect and simple dress shirt that fits well and is as described,1
Van Heusen is affordable and I like their quality is so awesome,1
My go to dress shirts,0
I actually wash mine on gentle vs dry clean and they stand up well to the wash and dry and is an easy ironable shirt,0
Very happy,1
Disappointed,2
"Van Heusen is a decent, consistent brand",2
usually,0
"I found this shirt to be short, a lot of loose strings on the seams, &amp",2
just not up to the normal standards,0
All that aside the shirt serves its purpose,0
My son wore this to perform in his high school jazz concert,0
You get what you pay for,0
Wrinkle Free ?  Should say wrinkles free,0
"No matter how many time you iron/steam/press these crappy ""Popplin"" shirts, the wrinkles will not go away",0
DON'T buy this item if you are slim,2
I'm 6 ft 130,0
ish,0
lbs and I was swimming in this shirt,0
The quality was ok and definitely was NOT wrinkle resistant as it was already very wrinkled when it was delivered,2
The sleeves were too long as well,2
"It's only 35 percent cotton, and that gives it a plastic feel",0
It also wrinkles more than most shirts when washed,2
My recommendation: don't pay the price,2
Buy a different shirt,2
These Van Heusen shirts are great shirts for work,0
Well made shirt it wasn?셳 too see through and wasn?셳 stiff,1
I purchased it for Formal night on a cruise,1
It didn?셳 really wrinkle much and I didn?셳 have to iron it when I took it out of the suitcase,2
What little wrinkles were on it went away after I had hung it up and wore it,0
Small especially at wrists,2
Some small blemish on pocket and collar,2
Not wrinkle free,2
Later,0
VERY MUCH WRINKLES,0
Excellent shirts,1
I own quite a few at this point and wear them daily,0
I think they are a good investment,1
This is a great shirt,1
My husband has to wear black for work and we seem to always get shirts that fad to some horrific gray color,2
I've washed this shirt twice now and it's still the same as it came out of the package,2
Very good purchase,1
This shirt would be great except for one fatal flaw,0
The size tag sits up quite high on the collar and is fairly long,0
As such it flops around and scratches my neck,0
It can not be simply torn off or the shirt tears,0
US expat overseas,0
I've ordered Van Heusen regular fit shirts from Amazon in the past,0
Obesity has changed the fit,0
Very sad,2
Great fit- easy to care,1
My husband loves this shirt,1
FYI  Takes about 2 washes to be wrinkle free out of the dryer,1
Laundered this shirt at home about a dozen times and the color,0
black,0
hasn?셳 faded yet,0
"Threads are holding up well, too",1
Delivery was good,1
The shirt  is well cut and fits,1
The material is,0
where is the cotton,0
synthetic feels and acts like synthetic or many refer to as nylon with no feel of cotton,2
"Very wrinkled upon arrival, dampened it and dried in dryer with a damp towel on low heat did remove the wrinkles",2
I would not purchase this shirt again,2
"The shirt arrived on time, and the sizing was accurate",1
"It looked like the shirt had just been shoved into the plastic wrapping, it wasnt folded, nor did it have any supporting cardboard or pins you would expect with a dress shirt",0
My assumption is it had been returned to the seller and they had just shoved it into the bag in the state they had gotten it back in,2
"the neck seems more like just under 16, not 16 1/2 and the sleeves also suffer from being shorter than advertised",0
Needed a cheap white shirt fast,0
Didn't have time for dry cleaning,0
Threw it in the wash and perm press,0
Came out nearly wrinkle fee,2
One more wash probably would've done it,2
More polyester than cotton so not very iron-able,0
"Sweated like crazy in this thing, become somewhat see-through",0
If you're a sweater you know what I mean,0
"Also note, this has a pocket",0
Guess I didn't take the time to look in the description if it did or not,2
Will purchase again instead of getting robbed by ubsurd Men's Warehouse prices,0
The dimensions of the shirt were accurate except for one part,0
The ARMS,0
The arms are too big in circumference??,2
Looks completely ridiculous,2
They need a new tailor to design their shirts,2
Its a nice shirt,1
The material is very thin,2
"I agree the other review, it is not any better than a Department store house brand of Mens dress shirts",2
I have a couple of the Costco  Mens white dress shirts,0
The Cotton is thicker and far nicer,0
They last a long time,1
Those were not much more money,2
I bought a new Brooks Brothers Blue Mens dress shirt,0
The best shirt I have ever owned,0
It cost me $6,0
99,0
So much for getting Dress shirts at Amazon,0
Bought a few of these because I like the brand,0
They're nice shirts,1
these are not wrinkle free for sure,2
"You may still need an iron, or need to not mind going to work with a few wrinkles",2
Not saying don't buy them,0
"just be aware they're not ""wrinkle free""",2
I've used several Van Heusen shirts of the same size and model as this one that fit and feel great,0
"These, for some reason, are shorter and wider, and feel harder and of lower quality",2
"In short: these are cheap, low quality shirts with a messed up fit",2
You get what you pay for,0
Would not recommend buying this product,2
Went to return it and it wasn?셳 not worth the haste,2
Just would not recommend,2
Ordered this cheap shirt for part of a Christmas party outfit,1
The shirt was unwearable,2
Forget my stomach,0
"If you're burly,  this will not fit you properly",2
"It was more slim fit than ""regular"" in my mind",0
"I usually wear a smaller shirt in an atheltic cut and it's fine, this larger sized regular simply didn't fit",0
I bought this despite negative reviews for wrinkles because all wrinkle-free shirts need to be ironed initially and are usually okay after that,1
Not with this shirt,2
After ironing it gets wrinkled again after wearing it for five minutes,2
Shirt is nice quality,1
Shirt fits as expected,1
I have a large neck and have to buy my shirts accordingly so fit in the body is always a bit loose / oversize,2
I always buy Van Heusen shirts,0
"For some reason Van Heusen doesn't believe a torso can be proportional to arm length, or they have a mission to perpetuate the plumber's crack into the business casual market",0
The title says Big and Tall,0
The sleeve length is long,2
The patterns must be based on an Edward Gorey sketch,0
This is a very nice shirt,1
My husband is tall and it was long enough in the tail to tuck easily,0
I washed it and was concerned that the tag stated that it should be STREAM IRONED,0
No ironing necessary,1
A very nice,1
and easy to maintain,1
shirt,0
I do not overstuff the dryer so that is not the issue of why it comes out wrinkled,0
Would likely not buy another given that it needs ironing and would not travel well,0
The shirt was nice looking and the color was beautiful,1
The shirt didn't fit because he ordered the wrong size,2
We sent it back and Amazon made a very quick refund so that we could get another shirt,2
Unfortunately i believe that this is the first bad review that I?셶e ever written,2
The shirts appear to be irregulars,2
The seams on the collar were very poorly sewn,2
They got even worse after they were washed,2
I ordered a,0
The color really pops out and the fit is amazing,1
This is a VanHusen,0
Nothing more to be said,0
The shirt fits exactly to advertised size and really looks nice,2
I steam iron the packing wrinkles out and the cloth laid perfectly,1
A really good shirt,1
At $21,0
"99, what I paid for this shirt, this is a good buy",0
At $44,0
"99, the price when I was asked to review this, it's a truly terrible buy and nowhere worth the price",2
I'd have shopped at JC Penney for shirts instead,0
Delivery was as advertised,0
I inspected the shirt closely and found no flaws or defects,1
"I'm very pleased with the cut, fit and weight of the material",1
I don't think I have ever had a Van Heusen shirt that I didn't like,0
I will probably order more of these,1
Ordered shirt to wear during Christmas,0
Got it out to wash before wearing the other day,0
Found threads pulled in the front of the shirt just under the pocket,0
The pulled area was about 3 inches long,2
"Return window is closed, guess i am stuck with a defective shirt",2
"I'm 5' 9"" 200lbs and I wear 16 1/2 34-35",0
I am a gentlemen Who prefers a little slimmer fit,0
My chest is 40??my neck is 16 1/2 all my suits are European cut,0
I am slim and trim,0
So this dress shirt fits OK it?셲 just not the tailored look I prefer,0
The shirt will work for my Christmas party,0
Bought for a band concert for my son so I was guessing on size and quality,0
"Brand is a good, well-known brand so that is why I went with it",1
I am happy I did,1
I did get an undershirt due to it being a little thin and I wanted to protect shirt form sweat,0
This was a great buy - I needed a white shirt for event and could not get to a store - it was delivered  in a timely manner and fit as expected,0
Excellent,1
Good shirt for the value,1
Fits well,1
I took off 2 stars because one of the sleeve had what seemed like a short black thread at the end of one sleeve,2
This should have been detected before shipping,0
A great shirt for the price,1
"Had to buy a dress-shirt for a sudden interview, and this was a great quick find",0
It fits perfectly,1
Nice comfortable cotton shirt,1
And I got the Job,0
"So, I suppose it's a lucky shirt :P",0
"I'm 5'9"" and 190 pounds",0
a bit overweight,0
I should have checked the waist,0
it was stipulated,2
"Next time I buy a ""tapered""  or ""slim cut",0
These shirts are comfortable and maintain their shape well after multiple washes,1
They don't wrinkle easily and the collar stays nice and stiff,1
My husband likes regular cut dress shirts and has trouble with his collars fitting,1
He discovered that Van Heusen is the best fitting dress shirt for him,1
Problem has been that major department stores carry only limited colors,2
So he was thrilled to find so many more choices on Amazon,0
only issue is that the product is a bit too big,2
"The collar is very nice, and the rest is good",0
"Great, you screwed me out of 2 shirts here",1
Your sizing chart is B,1
Measurements on your chart did not size up to what I needed,0
Small all the way around,0
"This is a shoddy product, don't trust the measurements at all",2
Would never recommend this to anyone,2
Should have gone to a store instead of trusting any of the crap,0
Shirt fit great,1
Does not run too large or too small,0
Bought one to test the size and its great,0
Will order a few more colors,1
I use these for work and it's great to have a variety,1
Wash correctly so you dont fade the colors over time,0
Thats true with any dress shirt,0
Needed a red shirt for a holiday dance routine,0
I could not find one in the stores that fit properly,1
Ordered this shirt from Amazon and to my delight it fits great,0
It is the perfect red color too,1
I wore it for an interview and got the job offer,0
VH is my go-to company when it comes to long sleeve dress shirts,0
Some other companies sell shirts that are either top short or are too wide and they look sloppy,0
These fit great and aren't expensive at all,1
I believe I now own six of these VH shirts,0
"The material wasn?셳 too see through so that was fine, just the fit was off",0
I bought the shirt to wear in concerts with the brass band l play with,0
It is comfortable and well made,1
I  will buy it again if I need another black shirt,1
"Great, accurate fit",1
Good material and high quality shirt,1
My only comment/suggestion is to Van Heusen itself - please cut back on the tags and packaging materials,0
"As most dress shirts have stopped using pins and unnecessary tags, you have gone the other direction",0
2x,0
and pins,0
Others can fold shirts without pins and maybe just one tag,2
"Otherwise, good shirts",1
Good dress shirts,1
Lots of colors,1
I personally like the cut of the collar opening,1
"Not too wide or too narrow, so it looks good with either a single or double Windsor knot in a tie",0
Reasonably priced,1
Really needs to be done professionally or ironed,1
The material is not very wrinkle resistant compared with many other shirts,2
It does look nice when pressed,1
Love Van Heusen shirts,0
I bought three of them for my husband for Christmas,0
They fit as expected and are great quality dress shirts,1
What I love about this shirt is it wash and wear,1
Dry cleaning is not a necessity,1
"You can pull it straight out of the dryer and not have to iron it unless you want to, unlike many other dress shirts I?셶e owned that turn into wrinkled mess",0
"This is probably due to the 60/40 cotton/polyester blend, which is nice",0
The material is a little thin and see-through would be my only complaint,2
It is a little more poly than I wanted,2
I got 2 shirts,0
The blue cant remember what they called it and a white,0
The blue is high poly blend,0
A little shiny and plastic feeling,0
The white was perfect,1
"Weirdly shaped and proportioned, very short sleeve length with cuffs 3??from wrists",0
"Cheap material, very thin",2
"Avoid this product, pay more for a real shirt",2
"Mostly, I'm just really excited that I found a dress shirt that fits",1
They're hard to find,1
"It's not as wrinkle free as some other shirts, and it has the permanent collar stays",2
which is really just a matter of preference,0
I have no idea how well it lasts,0
The collar is stiff and professional,1
I might get some more depending on how it lasts,0
It is a good shirt,1
I just sound unexcited because I'm picky,0
The measurements are spot on and the color is fantastic,1
I was looking for a shirt that was a little different color and this one does the trick,2
Absolutely love it,1
I would not buy this shirt again,0
The material is very low quality and for only a few dollars more you can usually scoop up a Calvin Klein or similar quality option,2
These shirts fabric are almost sheer they are so low thread count,0
I would not recommend,2
"Also, this yellow color looks like phlegm AND it's see-through",0
Bad times all around,2
"the color is very nice, crisp and clean",1
"The fit is as expected for someone who's around 5'11"" to 6 foot tall and just over 200 lb, paired with slacks and a tie it is an appropriate shirt for a work environment requiring you dress up",0
"The shirt is gr8 for work, its just a little too thin",0
"I ordered the white version of this shirt, and it was so thin you could easily see through it",0
I didn't even try it on - returned the shirt,2
"The three Van Heusen shirts I ordered were just what I was looking for, They fit well and after an initial ironing they have not needed ironing even after several washings",0
I'd recommend these shirts,1
"Ordered the shirts to use for a summer concert, and was ecstatic to get a shirt that was in skimpy and small as I am a large man",0
Very nice shirt,1
Got one for the hubby and one for the teenage son for our daughters wedding and it worked perfectly,0
Crisp white,0
Did not need a T-shirt under it,0
"The shirt fits as expected, hasn't wrinkled or faded and seems to be of good quality",0
I bought 2 more in different colors,0
Bought for a wedding,0
Check and waist was excellent,0
I used this product for my wedding today and it was almost perfect on me,0
The only part that does mot fit well was neck part,0
It was too tight and could not close it,2
We ordered an 18in collar and 34-35 sleeve,0
My husband normally wears an XL and this apparently meant a 2XL,0
There is no size chart posted on here to show what the collar/sleeve means in terms of sizing L/XL/2XL,0
Not happy,2
I don't know what else to say,0
fits as expected,1
and dark shirt is a perfect balance to a light tan pant,0
I wear it to work like once a week,0
And if you want to do the black on black or black on grey,0
go for it,0
great shirt,1
Been buying these shirts for quite some time now,0
Always a great formal dress shirt,0
Very nicely done and comfortable,1
This is my husband's favorite brand and style of shirt,1
It fits him perfectly,1
He has been wearing this style for years,0
Van Heusen makes great clothing in general and the dress shirts are my first choice,0
They fit me well and are very durable,1
I've got several dress shirts that are at least 4 years old and still get worn monthly,0
"For the price, these shirts are a great value",1
I use them for work as it is a formal environment and I love the fact that I just had to get myself comfortable with a size and fit and haven't had to look back again,0
"For persons that like the more ""modern"" fit that looks almost ""painted-on"" clothes, maybe the fitted ones would work, regular fit is looser at the body and can seem big on skinny persons",0
They just fit as I expect them to and I just buy the size and fit without worries about its sizing,0
Been using the brand for almost 20 years now,0
"The only problem with the shirt is the neck although described as 18 seems to be smaller and fits tight, My neck measured less than 18 so I was surprised it fit so tight",2
Clifton Warner,0
Perfect work shirts for husband,1
Washing and drying well,1
Big thumbs up on quality and price,0
Thank you Amazon,0
I needed the shirt ASAP- and that's what I got,0
Disappointed that the white shirt was see through,2
I bought this shirt because I wanted a nice dress shirt for work with a pocket as the picture indicated,0
"The shirt does not have a pocket, which I need because I offen put my glasses in it",2
The material is also thin,2
Will NOT buy again,2
Tuesday my husband realizes his shirt for the wedding are TOO BIG,0
lost weight,0
so Amazon to the rescue to deliver by Thursday in time to put in bag and drive to the wedding,0
Well know brand name to boot,0
Says wrinkle free and that?셲 not correct at all,0
I can?셳 get wrinkles out of it at all,0
It?셲 really big in the chest,0
Would not recommend,2
"When my husband wore this, his first feeling was that the sleeves seemed a teensy bit shorter than usual",0
His size is a M or 15 neck with 34-35 sleeves,0
The fit of this shirt was good,1
The material on the other hand is much thinner than I would have expected,0
It's a good thing I wear a T-shirt,1
I was a bit skeptical when I ordered this shirt as the price was lower than I usually buy my shirts at,2
I will be buying more of these,1
Great product,1
Revron,0
"i just took it out and ironed it for work this morning and my goodness,",0
if you are a big and tall guy like me this should be in your cart immediately,1
Wonderful feel very comfortable,1
"Another win for me, finding another dress shirts at a lower price than in the stores",0
Also I have an odd size that most stores dont carry,0
My new go to site for dress shirts,0
"This is my third shirt from this manufacturer and all fit, felt and looked as expected",0
It is really pinned and bagged for sales and shipment,0
Make sure you remove all pins,0
I am happy,1
The stitching is solid,1
Fit and finish are great,1
No loose threads hanging around,2
Material is soft,1
You cannot see through this shirt,0
"This is a wash and wear shirt, provided you use the",0
wash and wear cycle,0
The collar supports a tie,0
"Overall, this is a nice shirt",1
I ordered a regular fit shirt as advertised on amazon and it turns out that the way this shirt fits it fits as if it?셲 for a big and tall person,1
Nice shirt,1
"I've worn it about 6 times so far, 12 hours or so each time",0
It has been washed after each wearing,0
"It hasn't faded, shrunk, or developed weird wrinkles",1
Black cloths show lint,0
Such is life,0
"The quality is good, the stitching doesn't have flaws",1
This shirt is so nice,1
"It fits perfectly all the way around, and the length is just right",1
The quality of the shirt is great too,1
Would suggest an undershirt if you're getting too light of a color or a white one,0
"This shirt is advertised as ""Wrinkle Free",0
"""  This is anything buy the truth",0
The shirt came completely wrinkle and continued wrinkle after every wash,1
I purchased this shirt because it claimed to be wrinkle free,1
Very disappointed,2
Perfect fit for me,1
Very comfortable,1
"I was unable to find a size 18"" neck and 32"" sleeve anywhere in Colorado Springs",0
"Every size 18 neck had a sleeve length of 34"" or 36"" and I think I saw one with 38 or 40 inch",0
"I am 5'7"" tall with 32"" sleeves",0
"Neck sizes below 18"" are easy to find at 32""",0
Absolutely pleased with this purchase,1
The shirt fits great,1
"Now if it washed without shrinking and is wrinkle free, I will like it",0
Wrinkle free is bs,0
"Just washed and wrinkles everywhere, definitely have to iron",0
"Runs smal, got 17",0
5 fits like 17 with somewhat shorter sleeves- feels like it is shrinked from the normal size,0
Would not recommend,2
"Fits perfectly, looks smart, no frills, easy to iron",1
The permanent collar stays are a plus,0
once less thing to lose or break,0
Not a thing to criticize,0
A great value for the price,1
Ordering clothes on line is usualy a gamble,2
Not too red and not too loud,0
It's a very good color for a manly person who is boring with typical manly colors,1
I like the shirt and it fits well,1
I could not find a customer assistance person for this specific purchase,0
Fits almost perfect,1
"My husband loves Van Heusen shirts, and he wears a different one to work every day of the week",1
This shirt fits him perfectly and I love how sharp looking it is too,1
Washes and dries well too,1
I love all the different colors and will buy each one,1
"It fit perfect, I bought it for my boyfriend who is 6 ft 215 lbs, we got an XL",1
"Perfect shirt, wrinkle free, exact color we needed for a wedding that was using ivory and creams",1
"If you were shorter, you?셝 be stuffing a lot in your slacks",0
I like that the fabric is light,1
I bought it for a wedding in late July outside in coastal Virginia,0
Yikes,0
It may be fine until I take my Jacket off,0
So I will need to also wear a light T-shirt,0
Life is full of trade offs,0
Body of the shirt is to short for taller men,0
"The shirt fit lose in the waist, snug in the chest and fine everywhere else",0
I would buy this again,1
"Actually I did, I bought a short sleeve and then bought a long sleeve",0
Fabric is too thin for the paler colors I prefer,0
People shouldn't be able to see exactly where my undershirt sleeves end from twenty feet away,0
Shirt arrived in a plastic bag,0
not the original packaging,0
", which might have been okay if the shirt was not soiled",0
Not happy with this shirt,2
"It was part of a larger order, in which the others were in very good condition, which would have made the condition of this shirt comparably worse",0
These shirts are an industry standard,0
"They are crisp and clean and offer so much flexibility for the working man to never run out of shirts and always have the freedom to accessorize with ties, clips, slacks, and jewelry",0
These are a staple in any working man's wardrobe,0
"Exact Fit for the Size I picked, Needed for an event, came in time and served its purpose for me",1
Deep black color that does not fade,0
Nice fit and fabric feel,1
Cool to wear on any occasion,1
Great shift at a solid price,1
I got the white and it is prefect,1
Not to heavy a material or to light weight,1
Washed and dried  few times and it still looks wonderful,1
Fit is great with plenty of room to move without looking oversized,1
I will be getting more dress shirts com here in different colors,1
This is a solid deal,0
I was sent the wrong size on the light blue one ordered,0
I ordered the exact shirt in white and it fit perfectly,1
No question if it would have been the right size I ordered I would be to big it a 5-star review and perfect fit,0
Stuff happens,0
I'll mark it up as too bad for me on this one,2
I had already taken it to the dry cleaner before I noticed the size was off,0
in that they're all wrinkled when you take them out of the bag the first time and take all the pins out,2
or I would have returned it,2
I wore this shirt for the first time on Tuesday,0
"It fit perfectly, was comfortable and was attractive",1
I purchased the same shirt a year or so ago and it has held up quite well,1
Would heartily recommend this shirt for someone who needs a white dress shirt,0
Shirt fits perfectly,1
Same great quality as you would find in a department store,1
Good price on Amazon,1
Easy to get the color and size I wanted,1
"This is a great long sleeved, wrinkle free dress shirt that I would recommend to anyone",1
La mejor opci처n en camisas lindas y de f찼cil planchado es VAN HAUSEN,0
Its one of my only shirts that actually needs to be ironed,2
"I love the color, fit and price of this shirt",1
I'm surprised to say it fit perfectly because that doesn't happen for me,1
"seems well made, although material is a bit thin",1
This could be a plus in warm weather,1
Fabric seemed really cheap,2
Bought the ?쐓ame??shirt at the van Heusen store and this version is cheap and thin,0
?삍?삍,0
Perfect for and amazing quality just know your size and it?셲 right on point,1
My fianc챕 loves it,1
This wrinkles easily and feels cheaper than other brands,2
You get what you pay for,1
"If you need a black shirt, this is the best I found",1
"It's well made and it fits, as I'd expect from Van Heusen",1
"On the other hand, I wish they had raised the price and used a better material",0
The shirt is mainly polyester with enough cotton that it doesn't feel like polyester,2
although you won't mistake it for a good cotton/poly blend,0
It's a great shirt,1
I love the color,1
The only issue is that it runs a tad large,0
It's definitely worth the purchase,1
I thought that this was an oxford cloth with some texture and thickness,0
This was very cheap thin fabric,2
I was looking for something like a polo oxford cloth dress shirt,0
This is not it,0
Nothing I disliked about it,0
I have been very satisfied with Van  Heusen shirts,1
"The shirts are great quality, liked the fabric and how well made it is",1
I highly recommend this shirt,1
This is totally my mistake,0
I am returning the shirts and am re-ordering in the correct size,0
This shirt is perfect in every way,1
"As shirts go, I'm pleased with this shirt",1
My only gripe is the sleeve length,0
My arms are shorter than the standard length shirts come in,0
This shirt fits the price,0
It's not too great and definately not bad,0
"Material is a little thin, we get what we pay for",0
"For the price, I expected a lower quality thinner material",2
Had to iron after first wast to remove the factory creases,0
Could not wear,2
It wasn?셳 a Van Heusen shirt that showed up,0
It was a very cheap Amazon Essentials,2
It looked worn and the black color was faded,2
"The shirt is so cheap, it had no collar stays or lining",0
the collar is so limp and certain to curl up,0
5 32,0
It was laughable small,0
Shirt arrived quick,1
"Since you can?셳 order American sizes, s,m,l,xl,xxl, I referred to the size chart for an xl shirt",0
It said order the 34/35 with and 18??neck for xl and I did,0
Re ordered a 34/35 with 17??neck to see if it comes back xl,0
"Good shirt though, just the size chart might be off",1
Great packaging and shipping,1
Shirts are a regular fit so they were pretty wide around the chest and belly,0
Putting threw a wash/dry to see how they hold up and if they are truly wrinkle free,0
If not I will return,0
This was a good deal on lightning sale,1
Van Heusen shirts are well made and I always like the way they are cut and fit,1
My go-to,0
"I'm 6' 2""",0
"I'm 6'2""",0
Pros:,0
Well worth the $18 I paid,1
The fabric is ok,1
not great,1
"Stiff collar, which I like",1
Less Ironing,1
Cons:,2
Color is a bit dimmer than this pic,2
"Its baggy for 17"" Neck 34""-35"" I'm 6' 2"" 190 lbs",2
Pretty decent quality dress shirt,2
I would buy another one just like this if I needed it,2
maybe a different color,2
I've gotten two of these shirts now,1
One was a black,0
more of a charcoal,0
and the other was a blue,0
nice and deep blue,1
The size I ordered fit exactly as it should for the dimensions I ordered,1
Fabric feels quality and breathes well,1
Definitely recommend,1
Wish they had more colors,1
"This shirt fits perfectly, is comfortable, and it's a quality fabric that's not cheap our light weight feeling",1
I'm very happy with it,1
This was a Christmas gift for my husband,1
ordered size according to sizing chart and it was true,0
Shirt fits perfectly and he was delighted,1
Very nice quality,1
"Fit very good, material seems to be the same as the ones in retail stores",1
I'll buy again,1
There was no surprise,0
"I have other shirts similarly described, and they fit, so I took a chance on this one and was not disappointed",0
The shirt looks good and is reasonably resistant to wrinkles,1
Bought this shirt for my son,0
He wanted a nice shirt for his grndpa's funeral,0
"Grest shirt, boy was handsome wearing it",1
It's the quality of Van Hessen I expect,1
They have better fitment for a little more money,1
Title says much,1
"Chemical sensitivity exists for many people, and use of fragrances has declined over the years",0
It was thrown in the plastic bag with no tags completely wrinkled,2
Pretty sad that someone's returned item I paid full price for,2
I think I have like five or six of these that I wear constantly,1
I'm a bouncer and these shirts go through and withstand quite a bit of abuse before wearing out,0
That should tell you something,0
I was pleased with the fit and appearance of this shirt,1
Shirt is well made of  a quality material,1
I especially love that I don't have to iron this shirt,0
Looks great after drying at low heat in the dryer,1
I alway remove wash and wear clothes at the end of drying cycle,2
These are very good quality shirts,1
It?셲 a little difficult to get the right next size by online measurements,2
Once I found the right size it was dialed in perfectly,1
"This shirt fit perfectly,  another one tight fit around the waist",1
Fits nicely and just need to see how they tolerate the wash cycle,1
He usually wears a small shirt and I didn't know that a 16 neck was a large,2
"With a jacket, no one even noticed",0
I ordered at the last minute and the shirt came on time as promised,0
The fabric was too thin,2
A t-shirt didn?셳 help,0
"I am a short guy with a gigantic neck, so I am hard to fit and these actually fit very well",2
Colors are great and even the red does not seem to wash out,1
"This shirt does not need a lot of ironing, it?셲 a good looking shirt and I will likely buy another one",1
Great shirts,1
It was past time to get some new white dress shirts,0
These fit the bill and I think I'll get about four more of them well I am thinking about it,1
The value seems pretty good - absent a clearance I don't think I have seen them for less,1
This shirt was an all around lie,0
"I work at a tuxedo shop and sell fitted shirts daily, i was looking for a cheaper shirt since ours can be a bit pricey",0
These are not fitted and the measurements were horribly off,2
i wear a 15-15,0
5 neck with a 34-35 sleeve length so that is what i ordered,0
o boy was i surprised when i tried it on,0
not anywhere close to being fitting,0
its terribly off,2
"i added 2 pictures, the white one is the one i purchased from here",0
5 neck by 34-35 sleeve,0
"the light blue one is from the store where i work, also 15",0
5 neck by 34-35,0
"I had to buy one of these, regular fit, from a hotel gift shop",0
for $45,0
at like 11pm when I had absolutely no shirts for a business event the next day,0
I then went back to my room and ordered the slim fit from amazon to arrive the next morning,0
Laurent poplin shirt,0
I'm talking $300 per shirt,0
"Poplin is a very thin weave, and it's supposed to look silky smooth",2
"compare to broadcloth, oxford etc",0
which are thick weaves and which look relatively coarse,0
"It's more for summer wear, and works particularly well if you have to wear your suit all day",0
And yes always wear these with an undershirt,0
You see male models pulling off that sort of look,0
"Any way, I can see not liking the shirt",2
That's what it's supposed to do,1
"The fit is a little large, so definitely get the fitted",0
and not normal,1
and maybe the extra slim if they make that,0
"That being said, I haven't seen what happens to these after 10 washes",2
The cut is also not super-modern,2
It's fine though,1
"It's like a normal cut, which you might prefer if you don't want to be too stylish / like a dandy etc",0
For $20 this is a ridiculous deal,0
"I'm 6'2, 220 lbs",0
I purchased the 17,0
"5"" x 36/27 and was delighted at how well the shirt fit me",1
Many of the older dress shirts I own are very baggy and needed to be folded over and tucked-in in order to create a clean look,1
"After receiving my shirt, the package indicated that it's a ""slim fit"" shirt versus a ""fitted"" shirt as described in the product title",0
The slim fit shirts are the most fitted type of shirt offered by Van Heusen,0
I'm attaching a helpful chart that describes each of the different types of fits,1
"I've also seen similar charts from Van Heusen that respectively describe the sizes as regular fit, athletic fit, and slim fit",0
Many reviews indicated that the white dress shirts are thin,2
I checked out the shirt in a department store before buying,2
I placed my fingers behind the fabric of this shirt in addition to other brands and found that the thickness/transparency is about average,0
"Due to the nature of white shirts, I do believe that they are best worn with an undershirt underneath",0
This shirt is no exception,0
The price of this shirt is very affordable and provides great value compared to other brands,1
"The only con, as other reviewers have noted, is that the collar stays are permanently sewn into the garment",0
The collar stays are plastic so they won't rust,2
"In summary, great value and comfortable to wear",1
"I am 6'4"" so I need really long sleeves",0
"In fact, I have another Van Heusen shirt that is supposedly a 34/35 and its sleeves are inches longer than the shirt I purchased on here",0
"In addition, if you look at how I loosely measured the sleeves in the pictures, the slack in my measuring tape only adds length to the measurement so the sleeves are, in reality, even shorter than my measurement shows",0
Don't buy this shirt,2
I own other Van Heusen fitted shirts that I purchased in store which are softer and provide more room in the shoulders,0
I then ordered a 17 thinking it would be a better fit,0
The size 17 does not provide much more room than the 16 1/2 did,0
"The shoulders are tight, the chest is slightly larger, the length is longer, the waist is a little larger than I would like",2
I go to the gym and have a large chest with a slimmer waist,0
I own a size 16 Van Heusen fitted shirt that fits me better then the 16 1/2 I ordered on Amazon,0
I own a size 17 that I purchased in store and it provides significantly more room than the 17 ordered from Amazon,0
"In my opinion, the shirts sold on amazon are irregular",2
Perhaps they were made for another region,0
The material does not feel the same as my other Van Heusen shirts so I question if they are knock-offs,0
The amazon shirts are more stiff and less comfortable,2
I am unhappy with this purchase,2
"I purchase fitted, not slim fit, shirts because of my muscular build",0
You would think that by the year 2020 they would learn to stop sticking needles through the fabric to keep dress shirts folded in the package,0
There are several other issues with this shirt,2
1- This is NOT slim fit,2
I compared this with a CK brand slim fit dress shirt and the sizes were far apart,0
"2- It says ""wrinkle free",1
""" They even have a tag that says ""wrinkle free"" on the shirt",1
The shirt came wrinkled,0
3- The shirt is see through,2
It's so bad that even if you wear a male tang top underneath you can see that too,2
4- There are stickers everywhere,2
If you like random gray squares on your shirt where the stickers used to be then buy this,2
5- As i said,0
there are more than 10 needles stuck through this shirt that you have to pull out,2
Stop it,0
It damages the shirt and no one needs random needles hanging around their house,2
I regret buying this,2
It is paper thin and shows more skin tone through than any other dress shirt I own,2
Serious flaw,2
"Might be ok in a dark color, looks cheap and bad in white",2
"On the positive side, the fit is perfect and true to size",1
Not overly long or billowed out,0
The collar is also on the small size,0
Is plain white fabric so expensive they had to make it super thin and with an undersized collar?,0
It is a shame Amazon doesn't have a basic white dress shirt at a low generic price,0
I have had to graduate from a 17-1/2 collar to an 18,0
"I am a singer and my neck size has kept increasing and hopefully, it will stay an 18",0
"Anyway, the shirt is very comfortable and the collar size just right",1
I have a little room in the collar and that helps,1
The body of the shirt is just right and the shoulder seam comes a little below the end of the shoulder,2
My wife approves,1
The material is comfortable and soft,1
It came out of the dryer wrinkle free,1
"As for the fit, it was better than I expected",1
Great product,1
I have ordered three more,1
Hope that they are the same,0
I probably have a 16-1/2 body size with a 18 neck,0
No equality there,0
I paid about $13,0
50 for this poplin long sleeve FITTED shirt from Amazon,0
"The shirt is ""wash and wear"" 65% polyester and 35% cotton",0
Don't pretend that you didn't know what you were getting,0
Fitted means tapered towards the waist,0
I bought the Persian Blue color which is a really nice dark navy blue,0
"Sometimes, you need a break from black",0
The color is dark so the shirt is not see through,0
"To minimize wrinkles, for those that are not familiar with doing laundry:",2
Take the shirt after washing it and grab the shirt by the collar,0
Give it a few hard shakes / thrusts as if you were shaking the sand off a beach towel,0
Then throw the shirt in the dryer,0
Prices can fluctuate wildly,2
"If the shirt costs more than $20, you can probably get the Van Heusen stretch flex collar dress shirt with spandex instead",2
Update 12/5/20:,0
I bought a light purple shirt for &lt,0
A great buy,1
"This shirt is HUGE, it hangs in billowy folds off me and tucking it into slacks is like taking in a main sail",2
"In what sense this could be called a ""fitted"" shirt is beyond my comprehension",1
Holy cow,0
Just a completely unflattering cut of a shirt,2
"The sleeves are so voluminous, you would need three meaty arms just to fill one",2
The collar hangs away from my neck like I'm a malnourished child in my obese father's clothing,0
This was a comically bad purchase and this shirt went straight into the donation bag minutes after it was unwrapped,2
I typically wear more expensive designer dress shirts,0
Only because I've had bad experiences with cheap dress shirts being scratchy and uncomfortable,0
And I actually don't make enough to just go buy expense shirts whenever I need,0
I needed one fast on a tight budget,0
I was pleasantly surprised,1
This feels and looks like a much more expensive shirt,1
"I was originally planing on just using this temporarily, and replacing it with something better when I get the money",1
"Bought one of these thinking that at that price, if it was at all decent, I'd buy10",2
"Well, it was even worse than the price would suggest",2
The tag said it was a 16-inch neck,0
my size,0
5-inch neck,0
And I looked like I was trying to create my own clown costume,0
Tossed it in the trash without bothering to return,2
Save your $20,2
This shirt fit my very broad shoulders without leaving a lot of material hanging down to my slimmer than average waist,1
The arm to shoulder seams were at the exactly correct location,1
"There were no defects or problems with the construction, and I have bought several of the same shirts in different colors three different times here",1
I have professionally laundered the ones I had already at least 3 times and no problems staying together,1
I do recommend these shirts if you wear long sleeve dress shirts daily and don't want to pay department store prices,1
Reliable dress shirt brand up until now,1
My guy is a 45 inch chest,0
He has been using his 17,0
5 34-35 Neck fitted Van Heusen dress shirts for work,0
THEY ARE FITTED,1
Bought another black this time around on Amazon at the same size,1
"It turned out loose, like he'd fare better with a size 16",2
Material is good quality as usual,1
It's hard for me to find dress shirts that fit well,2
There are two issues,2
One is how fitted it is,0
"I'm 5'10, 145lbs, slim torso",0
wear a 38R suit,0
and waist,0
"30""",0
"So the vast majority of dress shirts I'm swimming in, even when they're ""slim fit"" or ""fitted",0
""" The other issue is sleeve length: My sleeve length is ideally in between the 32/33 and the 34/35, so the former is usually too short and the latter is usually too long",2
These shirts are the best I've found in terms of satisfying both my slim body and my arm length,1
"I first found these at a Van Heusen outlet store at an outlet mall, and since they fit reliably, why bother trying to find something else that fits properly? I just buy these off Amazon whenever I need new shirts",0
"Right now, I have six of them",0
This review is for Van Heusen Poplin Fitted Long Sleeves shirt with 15,0
"5"" neck and 34-35"" sleeves",0
"This size has 18"" shoulder width and 37"" waist size",0
First and foremost in buying clothes is the fit/cutting,0
Overall fit is good,1
The neck and sleeve sizes are as expected,0
"I'm 5'9"", 175 lbs",0
"My chest is 42"" and this shirt fits very well",1
It might be too tight if I have a slightly thicker chest,2
"Arms should have enough room for up to 16-17"" arm",0
"Mind you this is a ""Fitted"" shirt, so the shape is slimmer in the mid section and larger in chest",0
"I never bought any Fitted shirt before, so it was a gamble",2
I was glad it turned out to be a good bet,1
Secondly is the material,0
The fabric is decent and feels a bit rough to the skin,2
The wrinkle-free fabric is mixed of 65% polyester and 35% cotton,0
I've worn it for the whole day and it didn't get wrinkled easily,2
"It comes with a ""Oeko-Tex"" tag that says tested for and free of harmful chemicals",2
The workmanship is mediocre and lack of accuracy in the details,2
I bought 2 colors of the same shirt and one of them feels tighter than the other,0
Summary: I like it and bought 3 more,1
Would be better if it comes with removable collar stays/inserts and more color options,0
"I bought this white shirt for a last minute graduation outfit and wow, it couldn't have been worse",1
"All that aside, the shirt also creases terribly with even the slightest wear",2
"In short, it's not wrinkle free and it's definitely not fitted",2
They are not your standard sizes like all the others I've purchased before,0
Was slightly disappointed to say the least,2
So maybe size up on the sleeves when ordering,0
"Unlike the slim fit version of this shirt with the stretch collar, this one fits similar to a trash bag with arm cut outs",0
"I honestly don't know how this company gets away with calling this ""fitted"",unless the measurement was intended for a hippopotamus",2
"In addition to the awful fit, the material is scratchy and irritates the skin",2
"I'm 5'8 with an athletic build 175lbs, had to order the 16'1/2 collar with 32/33 sleeve length",0
Due to the size of my neck I received a large shirt that would need lots of tailoring,2
add an extra 10-15$,0
"So yeah, if your trying to achieve that tapered V look I'd recommend looking elsewhere",0
Tall men beware,0
I'm not unusually tall only 6'2'' and normally don't need tall shirts,0
I guess they are making everything for short people now because these things only tucked in 1 inch,0
I don't sag my pants either just a regular guy who has to wear this stuff,0
For some reason they cut the sides of these way shorter than the front or back,0
I put them next to Arrow shirts I got in the same size from Kohls and they were a good 2 to 3 inches short on the sides,0
I couldn't even sit or turn and out they would come,0
I?셶e spoiled myself with quality shirts I buy from second hand stores like Savers,0
Great fabric and quality construction,1
I ordered these Van Heusen shirts for my slim build and a proper collar fit,0
Buying second hand I get quality materials and nicely shaped collars,0
Collar and sleeve sizing is correct,1
see comparison photo,0
I?셫 now a ?쏯ever Van Heusener??,0
My boyfriend wore this as part of his Halloween costume,0
We weren't able to find the right color anywhere except on Amazon and it arrived right before we needed it,1
We're disappointed because he can't wear it for anything else because it has a hole,2
"I have other Van Heusen and similar shirts that I love, and fit well",1
"fitted, slim-fit",1
I made the mistake of ordering based on measurements,0
"Regardless, these are close enough that I'll keep them, because I need them now, and with an undershirt they fill out alright",0
"The sleeve length seems good to me -- not too short, especially when I lift my arms",1
And the shoulder width seems good -- some larges I tried in-store have been too broad,1
The neck circumference is perfect,1
"The shirt length seems good, too -- doesn't pull out of pants when I lift my arms",1
This is a fabulous fitted dress shirt,1
Manufacturers seem to have forgotten the average Joe,0
"Well, this third l shirt is perfect",1
"This time I tried a 16 1/2, 35, fitted, and the fit is SO MUCH BETTER",1
"There is less baggy-ness around the middle, the fit around the chest is better, and the sleeve length is perfect",1
I highly recommend this product,1
This was the third time trying to purchase this shirt,1
"The first time, it had to have been labeled wrong as it was easily two sizes too large and was returned",2
"unwashed with neck sweat, oils and dirt left on the collar for good measure",0
and returned it,2
This third one fits as it should and is relatively wrinkle free,1
My only strikes against it are the square corner wrist cuffs and the thinness of the material compared to earlier versions of this shirt,0
Maybe it's been sitting on the shelf for a few years,0
I don't know,0
"It seems to have the ""perma-wrinkle' treatment applied",0
"Received it, washed it according to the international symbol instructions",0
Wrinkled as a shar pei swimming back to China,0
"Ironed it, ironed it again with steam",0
"Later, washed it, and had to iron it again",2
Buy Geoffrey Beene,0
"I have 4 of that brand, and never an issue",0
"I'll not buy a Van Heusen from Amazon Prime again, no matter what the price",2
Great fit,1
Matte black is refreshingly clean looking next to sateen materials,0
"Several compliments from co workers, and guests at work",1
"The weave is solid, and the shirt is completely opaque",1
This shirt really takes to ironing well,1
I can starch a crease in the arm that will be visible when I pull it out of the dryer after washing it,2
"I started with two, alternated them, and washed them between shifts",0
"After two weeks, I'm buying 3 more",0
"I just want 5 of these pressed and ready to go, so I know I've got a killer shirt ready to go to work every day",0
"At this point I'm so worried it'll vanish, I might even buy more, and keep them in plastic until my other ones wear",0
"I have paid up to $100 on a black dress shirt for a quality make, and look",0
This is $20,0
"WTF was I thinking? After seeing the way these fit the waist, I look at other people with shirt spilling over their pants like a sad muffin top, and rejoice knowing that isn't me",0
My husband loves this shirt so bought him another one,1
"Unfortunately, there were tiny dark spots like pen marks or dirt stains on the collar and shoulder of the shirt",2
I?셫 frustrated that I didn?셳 see them right away,2
Just a reminder to triple check before throwing out the packaging to send it back,0
Make sure you check the sizing chart on Van Heusen's website,0
"Amazon attached the sizing chart for regular fit, to this fitted shirt",0
"If you follow the Van Heusen chart, then the dimensions are perfectly accurate",0
"It really makes a huge difference for someone like me, who powerlifts",0
"For reference, I am 6'2"", 280",0
"I see some reviews on this shirt about sleeve length is off, I didn't have that experience",0
"I would also point out, that sleeve length is measured from the middle of the back, to the shoulder, down the sleeve, not just the shoulder and arm length",0
Wore the shirt for a wedding,2
including 5 hours at reception with 3 hours of dancing the shirt still looked great and wrinkle free,0
Received many compliments about the shirt,1
Shirt came very well packaged and I simply lightly steamed the shirt and it was ready to wear,0
You will not be disappointed,2
I bought the first one that fit great,1
So I ordered a second,1
It felt like I looked like a flying squirrel,1
The first had a normal display shirt with pins in it,0
"The second was a crappy Indonesian look alike that came with no cardboard, no pins, no proper packaging",0
Buyer beware,2
Received this Van Heusen shirt today,0
I had been ordering Slim Fit shirts,0
"5'9 tall, 32/33 Sleeve/ 38/40 waist-Neck 17",0
5-weight 195 lbs,0
"Only thing I could see was a slight taper to the waist, still pretty full",0
My problem is finding a shirt with comfortable neck that don't feel like an over sized tent,0
This product was great when I bought it in December so I ordered another one for Easter,1
It was the same sizing on the label,1
15 and 32/33 sleeve,0
I'm very disappointed,2
The sizing isn't consistent and I won't buy it again,2
This is a decent dress shirt for the price,2
"I have not purchased clothing like this in a long time and it fits as expected although next time as a 6' 1"" individual i will go with the 18",2
Happy with the purchase and will be buying more in the future,1
"This is a quality, true to size shirt by a designer brand, at an amazing price",1
I'm a big and athletic guy who hates the way dress shirts that fit my neck and shoulders often sag at the midsection if you don't have a big gut to hold it up,1
These are tapered just enough to prevent that,1
"Though they are not quite as tapered as I would like, I have no complaints",1
The price is excellent,1
The quality seems to be very good,1
"The colors are vibrant, and the material is very lightweight, which, living in Florida, I definitely apprectiate",1
"I bought four, so I'd have a variety of colors to wear regularly",0
Same price as Walmart's crappy storebrand,0
"After trying and researching countless shirt brands, this Van Huesen is perfect for me",1
"Fit, material, style, and quality is above average in my opinion",1
"Highly recommend this shirt, and have purchased nearly a dozen of these over the last couple months, replacing all my dress shirts with this Van Heusen",1
This shirt looks amazing,1
I got the dark purple color and it?셲 vibrant,1
It feels comfortable and looks classy,1
"neck size, belly size, etc",0
I would buy the shirt again in other colors,1
They are not long enough to stay inside you pants given that I buy the same size shirt for 25 years now,0
Bad brand too cheap,2
Search for another brand,2
They are also NOT wrinkle free and there are true wrinkle free shirts out there as I bought some after trying these,2
Should have stuck with what I had been buying,2
Too bad Amazon does not sell the better brand,2
I love this brand of shirts for three main reasons,1
The colour is always as described,0
The fit is always correct based on your measurements provided,1
It actually comes out of my dryer generally wrinkly free and ironing doesn't take hours,1
"I've bought a few of these shirts in different colours and the size, colour, and thermal compatibility with wrinkling of the material is always consistent",1
"The fit of this shirt is perfect for my frame - I?셫 ocd about having a dress shirt pocket, and I can pick up 6 white dress shirts as daily workhorses",1
"Unfortunately, it looks like a black thread was mistakenly stitched inside the shirt pocket - I can?셳 remove it as it?셲 trapped",2
"Second, the material already seems to have pilling or ?쐏icks??before it?셲 first wash",0
The search for white dress shirts with pockets continues,0
I wear dress shirts literally everyday,1
"Most of the ones I wear are from Van Hausen, they are not prohibitively expensive",1
They don?셳 fade and they don?셳 need ironing,2
These shirts are very very wrinkle resistant which is why I buy them,2
The only thing I will say is the black van hausen shirt is not the same shade of black as their pants are,2
How does it fit?  It doesn't,2
Bad fit,2
Shoulders: Too small,2
Too tight,2
Belly: way too big,2
I've bought many of these VH dress shirts in the past,0
"I always buy the ""fitted"" style",1
I always buy 16 34/35,0
"Either they have changed the style of their ""fitted"" cut, or else someone sewed in the wrong tag",2
Bad fit,2
"The tag is a lie, as this is not a ""fitted"" or ""athletic"" cut",2
"FWIW, all of my ten year old VH shirts in 16 34/35 still fit well, and look great",1
I wear 41 jacket with a 34 waist,0
The new one I must return,2
or donate,0
"I had ordered a made to fit shirt on October 31 for a January 2 event, software update issues created a delay",0
I purchased this shirt to wear to the event and the fit and look were outstanding,1
Bought for my son to wear to prom with his suit,0
He loved the fitted shirt as he is thin as he is a cross Country and track runner which keeps his physic thin so the fitted definitely worked better for him,1
"Great shirt that my 17 year old gave a thumbs up to and my son is very, very picky",1
I think this shirt is a tad too expensive for what it is,2
Paid 27 dollars for a 16  36-37  grey/charcoal color,0
Fabric material: appears to be a little too much shiny polyester fabric than what I would like,2
"I don't want to be wearing a plasticky ""george brand"" walmart no-iron shirt",2
That's why I paid more for a better quality fitted shirt like this,2
I would recommend everyone try out Stafford shirts,0
This is the first dress shirt that actually felt true to size and didn?셳 choke me,0
I hang dry my dress shirts because delicate drying usually shrinks them and that helps out here,0
It does wrinkle pretty bad so you will need to iron,2
I bought this during Amazon Prime days for $14,0
I wish I bought more colors,1
"I purchased the 15 1/2, 32/33 for my 5-11, 170 athletic son",0
soccer player,0
and he is very happy with the fit and quality,1
"I think he pulled the shirt right out of the bag and wore it from this picture, lol",2
Not bad since I only see some creases on the arms and I guarantee it wasn't washed,0
I was surprised at the poor quality of this shirt,2
"I have owned many dress shirts in my life, and probably half of a dozen where made by Van Heusen",0
"This is easily the worst Van Heusen shirt I?셶e ever owned, and one of the worst overall",2
"To be more specific, the seams pucker, even with serious ironing, including with starch",0
"Also, threads are coming out of a dozen places",2
"It is miserable to iron, and comes straight out of the dryer looking like a disaster",2
"Now, I?셫 on the prowl for a replacement dress shirt with which I can be happy",2
"Hopefully, it won?셳 cost me $75",0
Excellent shirt for a great price,1
These shirts fit my husband really nicely and he is of average build so I thought maybe slim fit would too to tight,2
Instead it fit his average size body very well and he looks great in them,1
They iron up nicely and the colors are contemporary,1
These are made for an average person not just a the athletic body of a 19  year old,0
They look great in the office and under sweaters,1
They have similar shirts at Costco for about the same price and these look better I think,1
Great shirt and great price,1
"Unfortunately, there was a yellow oily spot in the shoulder",2
"Fortunately, I was able to spot clean the spot and fade it enough for my son to wear it",0
"This was the second shirt like this we purchased that came with a spot, although the first was purchased at a Van Heusen store",2
"That spot would not come out and I didn???have time to return it, so I purchased one from Amazon",2
Was disappointed to find another spot on this one,2
It was about 1/2???/4??and should have been noticed,0
"I like the color, feel of the fabric, and wrinkle resistant material",1
Since I wear a jacket daily it isn't a problem and i will probably buy at least one more of these to expand my color palette,1
This is the second Van Heusen dress shirt that I've purchased,0
The first one was a regular fit and was really baggy around the waist,0
I got rid of it promptly,2
"This one, on the other hand, fits just right",1
I've worn it several times and it has held up well to machine washing with no signs of fading or damage,1
just remember to take it out of the dryer as soon as it's finished to prevent wrinkling,0
I like that the collar stays are embedded within the collar,1
it helps the collar keep its form without having to remember to take them out and put them back in when laundering,1
"Overall, I'm quite pleased with this shirt",1
Looks like it's best for me to go to my local suit shop as their products fit properly and are higher quality,1
"For an 18"" neck and 34-35"" cuffs, the shirt is too short, disigned for someone with a short torso",2
"I've been married for 34 years, so I guess I do have some experience on men's shirts :",0
These are the best shirts I have ever bought for my husband,1
I bought four shirts more than a year ago and again a couple of weeks ago,0
"The color doesn't fade, they fit perfectly and are definitely wrinkle free",1
He's very much satisfied with these shirts,1
1 - I am not sure how it's considered a slim,2
It's pretty baggy on me,2
This might be Fitted at best,2
2 - The cuffs are too tight if you wear anything other than the slimmest of watches,2
My watch actually gets stuck under it at the largest setting,2
My wrist is 6,0
"25"" which is like a baby's wrist",2
3 - I am not impressed with the wrinkle resistance so far,2
Maybe it will improve with a few washings / dryings,0
"Washed before wearing this shirt the first time, and it was still a bit stiff",0
"The color is holding up perfectly, and it feels sturdy",1
I expect to wear this shirt once a week for a long time,0
Can't go wrong with the Van Heusen name,0
I ordered this because it said slim fit,0
The shirt label says slim fit,0
"I am 5'10"" and weigh 180 lbs",0
I am medium build,0
The shirt fits like it was for a 220 lb person,0
I don't recommend it for anyone except an overweight person,2
The sleeves are too short,2
"Many reviews on here claim the same, I ignored them and bought it anyway",0
Now I'm stuck with the hassle of returning it,2
"The sleeves end two inches above the wrist, and when you bend your arm the wrist cuffs recede back even further",2
wrinkle free,0
are the only kind of dress shirts that I have bought for the past several years,1
They are unrivaled in terms of quality and fit,1
"In my experience, you cannot get a shirt that fits anywhere near this quality off the rack- you would have to pay big bucks for something tailored",1
"The fitted cut makes for an attractive shirt that compliments the torso, rather than being baggy and sail-like, as so many other shirts look",1
"When I ordered this most recent Van Heusen shirt, I was pleased to see that they had made some subtle improvements, and it is now even BETTER than before - and it was incredible to begin with",1
They made two noticeable changes,1
"Second, they made the width of the collar smaller, and this makes a huge difference",1
"The shirt looks much sharper, and the narrowed collar goes better with the modern, fitted cut",1
"Quite simply, this is a $25 shirt that looks like it cost $100+",1
I don't like buying cloths,0
This is especially true of dressy shirts because I have long arms and most department store shirts don't fit me even when the size tag says it should,0
The arm size is often marginal to begin with and after one washing- too short,2
"Also, I thoroughly dislike the hassle of having to return stuff",2
On top of that dynamic I cringe when family members try to buy me cloths,0
So when I do address the need to buy some clothes and I am successful I feel a very large sense of accomplishment,1
"Van Heusen is a name I trust and I was delighted to find a shirt with long sleeves, one that actually fit perfectly and looks great",1
"The tails are long enough so the shirt tucks in nicely, they didn't skimp on material",1
The sleeves have a bit of room to shrink and still fit nicely,1
I will definitely buy more of these Van Heusen poplin dress shirts,1
"Thanks to Amazon, and the time people take to write honest reviews, shopping is becoming a very pleasant experience",1
Look it???not a designer shirt,2
If you are looking for something to get you started or between days that your better pieces are at the cleaner???it???great for that,1
Need a shirt for a funeral or wedding and don???have one and don???want to invest a ton?  This will get you by,1
Runs a little small,2
"I am about 6'3""",0
I generally wear about a 15,0
"5"" neck, 36"" sleeve, and 44-46"" chest",0
I have a hard time finding a shirt with those measurements as well as being a bit fitted,2
This shirt fits well,1
The neck and collar are as documented,0
The fitted aspect of the shirt is also nice,1
I can't fit into most slim fit shirts because they are too tight at the chest or the arm,2
This one tapers down nicely without being too tight up top,1
It is a good work shirt,1
The color is a bit flat,2
"Of note, the collar stays are sewn in",0
You can't place your own metal stays in there,2
I don't know what will happen when I dry clean the shirt,0
My preferred shirt for work for the last few years,1
"Usually I had to wait for it to go on sale from JCPENNEY,and they only had select colors",2
"Now I see this on Amazon, game changer",1
I picked up one of almost every color,1
These hold up like no other shirt I've ever worn,1
The elbows do not wear out and it still looks new after a few years,1
"I love the way they fit, material is not too light or heavy",1
Hope this was helpful,0
This shirt will be a suit-only shirt as the sleeves bunch up like renaissance-era clothing,0
"Even rolled up to the elbow, they look too big",2
"Otherwise, the color is a true, pure white and the neckline is extremely comfortable and true to size",1
"Wouldn???order this shirt again, and wouldn???have ordered knowing what I know now",0
I??梨?likely stick to buying shirts in person going forward,0
The shirt was received looking like a wadded piece of material,2
I believe the shirt had been unpackaged and then stuffed back into a cellophane bag and not folded,2
"Moreover, I have ordered several shirts similar to this one",1
same brand,0
and there were several tags on them that were missing on this shirt,2
"Otherwise, the shirt was ok",1
at least it was not dirty or stained,1
"I just had a chance to look at my blue, long-sleeve, dress shirt",0
Much to my surprise it is a FITTED shirt,0
I never buy this type and I am thinking the info on the site was not very clear,2
"Thank you, David Blahnik",1
I ordered it for my son who needed it,0
It was two weeks late,2
We didn???need it by then,2
"I understand at this time, somethings may take longer",0
Really phenomenal purchase for the price,1
It is true to Poplin style in that it's thin and breathable,1
"if you're not wearing a jacket, you'll want an undershirt because it can be relatively see through",0
"Fits quite well, the taper is well done so it doesn't swallow you in the torso if you've got bigger shoulders and a relatively smaller waist",1
Saludos,0

This is not the Lux fabric,2
"Lux/Satin is more like silk, less like abbraisive cotton /polyester, it that makes sense",0
"For the price and the good fit, hard to beat",1
"In the future, I'll pay more for the Lux/Satin",0
I'm in Japan and am unable to find my size here,2
Amazon came to the rescue with their Global Shipping,0
"I'm 6'4"", weigh 270 pounds, have a 18",0
"5"" neck, 18"" arms and a 51"" chest",0
"Yes, I do lift weights",0
I bought the fitted shirt and a regular fit--both are comfortable and look great,1
"Normally, a shirt that fits me in the chest and shoulders looks like a tent around the waist",0
This shirt is different and the fit is perfect,1
I should also mention that the arm length is just what I needed,1
I actually like the thinner material and think the look is classy,1
Just my two cents' worth,0
Thank you Van Heusen,1
Good shirt especially for the price,1
Price even better that so-called outlet mall store for Van Heusen,1
"I very much prefer shirts, even casual shirts, that come in real sizes such as this",1
I ordered 16x34-35 and it fits me perfectly,1
I am likely to consider other colors in this same vendor and style,1
Recommend it,1
I purchased a blue 16,0
5 fitted and the fit was excellent,1
I followed up with a red and a white and they were not too close in same fit,2
About an inch tighter in chest,2
"May come from different manufacturers,  so order up a half size to cover their lapse of accurate measurements",2
"I bought this for a tall, skinny friend, and it looks great on him",1
It fits perfectly,1
we went by the indicated size,0
and the color is eye catching without being ostentatious,0
"After our success with the first shirt, we bought 3 more in different colors, and are very pleased with all of them",1
As someone who is short,0
5??8??,0
and slightly overweight,0
and I mean that,0
", these are the only off the shelf shirts that seem to fit me outside of getting custom made, which I have done overseas",1
I get the 16,0
"Outside of the fit, very comfortable, and easy to wash for lazy bachelors like me",1
I have one from almost 8 years ago and it???still hanging on albeit I wouldn???wear it for special occasions,0
This shirt had to be ironed after I washed it twice then putting it in the dryer for about 2 minutes  All my other shirts this method works to keep out the wrinkles,2
I use to buy Van Heusen Shirts &amp,0
they were quality now they are cheap,1
I had to take 1 star away for the cheap material and 1 star because its not wrinkle free,2
"If you're lucky enough to get an unopened shirt, then the quality is good",1
Nice clean cut,1
Fits well for slim/athletic body type,1
I received this shirt along with 2 others of the same style,0
It looked like someone tried it on then returned it,2
No one even tried to make it look decent,2
Check the picture out,2
This is how I received it,0
I didn't even open it up,0
Within 5 minutes it was back in the delivery envelope with a return tag on it,2
The picker and quality assurance team need some coaching,2
Come on Amazon,0
What a perfect dress shirt bought for my husband size 16??Neck 32??33??sleeve black color and its  just perfect fit well,1
He is about 185 lbs,0
5??f height,0
I???in decent shape and most fitted shirts are hit or miss on me,2
This was perfect,1
I???5??0??168 lbs and it fit perfectly,1
16??neck with 34-35??sleeves,0
Bought a second one,0
I gave up today on wearing this for a work dress shirt,2
The material is not that wrinkle free,2
They don't look nearly as good as my other dress shirts look straight out of the dryer,2
"Also, the shirt is cut too short so it comes untucked throughout the day and puffs out",2
If you wear shirts untucked then this shirt could work better,1
This is a nice shirt,1
"Since I almost never wear neckties, an open collar is just fine",1
"As an avid weightlifter, buying a shirt off the rack when your shoulder to waist proportions do not match the average male form can prove to be a difficult task",0
Sweet deal and I will be back for more given that I work in the city and shirt &amp,1
tie are standard attire,1
I recommend this shirt as something that's no-fuss that you can throw in the washing machine and not worry about,1
"You can put it in the dryer, and ironing isn't necessary",1
and that kind of convenience is certainly important,1
Needed it to be wrinkle free,2
Needed it to fit right,2
This checks all the boxes,0
"Not worried since its Van Heusen, decent quality and stitching",1
Fits well on me,1
Soft texture,1
Good shirts,1
"I've been through countless dress shirt makes/styles/series over the years and overall for the price and fit of these, they really can't be beat",0
"These newer ones are also a bit baggier, completely opposite of what I prefer and why I do ""fitted",2
""" Overall, can't really go too wrong with these",2
Poor fit,2
the reviews are overly kind,2
NOT like the same as purchased in-store,2
"Poor fit, collar is irritating, one shirt too small, the other a tent",2
Material is irritating,2
These ARE NOT like ones purchased in Kohl's etc,0
Sending both shirts back,2
Defective overall,2
I do not recommend,2
Save your $$$ and buy from a trusted source,2
These appear to be of suspect origin,2
I could not wear it and returned it to amazon for a full refund,2
"If you're athletic at all don't bother ordering, if you're of the less athletic persuasion this will likely fit",0
Van Heusen Men's Dress Shirt Fitted are amazing the quality and craftsmanship,1
I was a little apprehensive when I order it because I have never other Dress Shirt online,0
Van Heusen brand are great,1
I love everything about it,1
I will be ordering more and more and more,1
I totally recommend it,1
Bad quality,2
The shoulders are too tight and the stomach area looks like 10 times to large,2
If you have an athletic built then this shirt won???fit unless you tailor the waist tremendously,2
The shoulders are still too tight,2
The shirt is also very short length wise,2
Good in any mans closet for the gentleman's dressed up look,2
I am very particular about my dressed up look and this shirt is a good match for the look I am usually going for,1
The collar has to have the just right look and this shirt has the look,1
"Most notably, the stitching on the entire shirt was very disappointing",2
"It was either done manually by someone who didn't know how, or by a machine that was broken",2
"Either way, the fact that this shirt made it through any sort of visual inspection and allowed to be sold baffles me",2
"And on various seams, the stitch doesn't go all the way to the end of where it's obviously supposed to go",2
"So as many of you probably know, Van Heusen and their sister brands",0
"Arrow, Izod, Chaps, etc",0
run very baggy and big--designed for the gentlemen carrying more than a few extra pounds--I'm guessing a BMI of 30 or higher,2
"Normally, you have to go down a size from expected with them and deal with a tight collar,  or go with Slim Fit",0
"As for the ""Small"" people--I guess they're sending you to their Boys section",0
"The Slim Fit is usually decent, though nowhere near a true ""slim""--more designed for BMIs around 25",0
I had to return it,2
"Unless you're a bodybuilder, avoid ""Fitted""",2
Stick with Slim Fit for BMI 23-27 and standard for 29+,0
Go to other brands if you're actually slim,2
BMI 22 and under,0
Van Heusen? Really? These shirts are ridiculously tailored,2
I wear 17 1/2 x 37 shirts and these are the worst fitting things ever,2
Forget about wearing these shirts and being comfortable if you intend to move your arms,1
didn't work for me,2
the collar just didn't sit right so i had to return it,2
"so because the collar isn't great, it might have been better with a metal stay insert",2
"I mistakenly ordered 5 ""fitted"" shirts, rather than the ""regular"" shirts that I intended to order",0
I returned the five fitted shirts and ordered 5 regular shirts,0
The exchange and re-ordering went seamlessly,1
I received the regular shirts and they fit perfectly,1
"In fact, I am wearing one today and it looks fits, looks, and feels terrific",1
I'm going to see if fabric softener does the trick,0
They are lightweight,1
"My son said they fit ""fine",1
""" He's 19 so I'm guessing he's not that finicky",0
They are for work,0
Nice shirt great fit,1
much nicer fit than regular which can just be way too much material to tuck in and of course ??諭뇁m fit??doesn???fit us big guys,2
nice alternative,1
My favorite shirts,1
I own several and of different colors,0
If you measure yourself,0
"neck, arm, chest, waist, and align them to the shirt measurements, you will find this shirt to fit perfectly",1
"If you don't measure slim or fitted, DON'T buy a slim or fitted shirt and expect it to fit well",2
That's not the way well-made clothing works,2
"If you find the material *too thin*, don't forget, dressing well involves dressing responsably",2
"wear an undershirt as is expected with all dress shirts, it keeps the shirt looking nicer and lasting longer",0
No one really wants to know what color your chest hair is or whether you find it chilly in that conference room anyway,0
They do want to know you are competant enough to know what size shirt and that you didn't get dressed in the dark this morning,0
"If applied properly, and with the light on, this Van Hussein will provide you with everything you need",0
It fit well,1
Similar fit can be obtained by a 17-and-a-half neck-size shirt with stretch-neck technology,0
also by Van Heusen,0
", 32/33, fitted",1
It was available through Kohl's deliver-to-store program,1
I ordered both concurrently to beat a deadline,0
There are permanent collar stays sewn in,0
For me that is a big negative,2
I can???use my magnetic collar stays since there is no open pocket in the collars,2
I only wear this with a tie which is not often,0
I always wear the magnetic stays when I???not wearing a tie,0
That doesn???bother me,0
Otherwise the shirt is fine,1
These are great shirts for the price,1
I ordered 4 of them,0
If you spill something on them you aren't out 40$ - 60$ for a shirt,0
"If you only wear dress shirts on special occasions or even every day and you are hard on your cloths, these are your shirts",1
"They look great, fit great, are decent quality at a great price",1
I like these shirts and they have plenty of colors to choose from,1
I'm pretty basic when it comes to clothes for work so these were great and at a decent price,1
This is the best white shirt I have purchased for my husband who wears them daily and to and from the doctor's office,1
The price is great and the shirt is made with such great care,1
I washed it and it had very few wrinkles - no ironing needed,1
My husband loves this - it is his favorite white shirt,1
If you are looking for a dress shirt that actually has a fitted fit then this is the one for you,1
It's more of an athletic fit where it is tighter in all of the right areas so that you don't look like you are wearing a trash bag for a shirt,0
I'll definitely be purchasing more of these from Van Heusen,1
The white color is fairly see through and I imagine it will only get worse the more wear it gets,2
If you are dark skinned it might be even worse,2
"I still gave it 5 stars because it's hard to find good ""athletic fit"" dress shirts and this is a great price",1
Slim on the body as advertised and I wanted,0
My biggest issue is how wide the sleeves are,2
From shoulder to wrist it is very large for a slim fit shirt,2
Looks and feels very out of place compared to rest of shirt,2
I love these shirts,1
they are thin,0
"of course, being poplin style",0
", which I have seen some comment as a flaw",2
I think this is a major strength of the shirts,1
they layer well under a suit or other professional uniform without getting too hot,1
also they iron very easily and hold their lines well,1
"That personal issue aside, these are great shirts and pretty much all I wear now",1
"Bought the 16""",0
"34""-35"" sleeve",0
roomy everywhere else,2
A smaller size won't work because he needs the room in the neck,0
Seems like good quality though,1
These shirts are decent depending upon your expectations,0
** I donated these to Goodwill and I bought Express performance slim fit for a few bucks more,1
Well worth it for me instead of these,1
**,0
"Somebody decided that from now on no dress shirts shall have pockets henceforth, and men should start carrying purses",0
instead of having pockets,0
"Guess what, some of us don't want to carry a purse and find shirt pockets incredibly useful for outdated things like a pen and maybe even a business card",0
Kudos to Van Huesen for not caving in to the fashion fad of the moment and actually making a product that is practical and useful,1
I have an athletic build with a thick neck,0
Most of the shirts that are big enough in the neck are too big and bulky in the torso,0
This shirt is a perfect fit,1
"I am actually wearing this shirt right now, which I thought was ironic as I was just scrolling through my reviews",0
Very nice looking shirt that has lasted since I bought it without any issues,1
I like it,1
It was much more like a regular fit with regular amounts of material left over around the waist,2
I hope this helps,0
Average shirt with a cheap price point,1
"If you want a cheap dress shirt, this is not a bad way to go",1
Fits true to size,1
"I bought on line because all the shirts in the department store had very thin material, almost see through,  and I wanted something thicker with winter coming on",0
These were not what I was looking for and just as thin as the others,2
"It felt very cheap and the stitching was really poorly done, which was surprising concidering how much I like Van Heusen dress shirts",2
I can't think of any occassion that I would wear it,2
I returned it,2
Sizing was good for me,1
I buy dress shirts in 16,0
"5 neck and 36/37 sleeve, which is hard to find at the stores",0
It???semi-transparent,0
"I???not a male stripper, so I can???wear this to the office",2
I love these shirts,1
Most other shirts I've gotten that call themselves wrinkle free are not,0
"I work in an air conditioned office and wear an undershirt, so I can get more than one wearing before I have to wash these shirts because they don't get wrinkled when I wear them",0
I generally buy a slightly higher end work shirt e,0
Joseph A Bank or Brooks Brothers,0
I decided to look for a somewhat less expensive alternative for every day use and this shirt seems like it might be a good choice,1
The fit is as expected,1
So far I have only purchases one as a test,0
I will update if I purchase more and find any inconsistencies with fit,0
The shirt is somewhat thinner than I am used too,0
I wear an undershirt so that wont really be a factor,0
So far so good,1
I'll update this after I wear it a few times,0
Always confuses about tailored vs slim fit,0
"That said, the shirt fit me well especially neck size which is always a challenge",1
"Already been to the cleaners several times and shirt looks good, fits the same as when it was new",1
I have a big neck and I have some 18,0
"5"" neck oxford dress shirts at home that fit fine",0
I ordered 18,0
"5"" inch in these shirts and the neck is about an inch too tight",2
I had to send them back,2
"It is especially important to  have access to ""fitted"" dress shirts--Van Heusen being my usual product of choice",0
"One major problem is that the distinction between ""fitted"" and ""slim fit"" shirts seems to be getting blurred",2
"""Fitted simply"" means that the waist tapers in slightly so that--with a slender person--the waist does not balloon out absurdly which happens with regular fit",2
"Slim fit means that the shirt clings tightly and is, therefore, not breathable",2
"Also, it restricts arm movement",2
"Increasingly, staff persons in clothing stores",0
especially department stores,0
do not understand the difference,0
There is a danger that the difference will be lost as sellers and manufacturers neither understand nor perhaps care,0
That is why I just ordered six more--in case they stop making my size and nothing works,0
Thanks to Amazon for getting me to the right product when neither the manufacturer nor most retail stores make it available,0
Please take note of these facts,0
It may be possible for Amazon to communicate the important distinction where it most needs communication,0
This is a fitted shirt for someone who looks like Rambo or Swartzenegger,1
"Otherwise, excellent fabric, excellent workmanship",1
"Nice shirt that resists wrinkles, sort of",1
"I work in a restaurant, and that's just the way it goes with fitted shirts",0
"For the price, I found it suitable and I was generally pleased with the shirt",1
I bought this for my husband,0
Overall the fit was good,1
He didnt complain,0
The one downer is the fabric is not unable to wrinkle,2
It came out of the package with wrinkles on the sleeve areas sooo much for wrinkle free :,2
We will see how it fairs after being washed,0
Good shirt,1
Alo seems just a little short at the waist,2
Just a bit,0
"These shirts are quality, its a tough fit for me as the collar is exactly what i need to not feel like im being strangled wearing a tie and the arm length is exactly what i need",1
Unfortunately with this particular style the arms are a bit baggy and the shirt tucks in a bit baggy as well,2
Im still pleased with the shirt wears well in all occasions,1
"""My eyes are up here, Ma'am",0
"""  I've given this shirt three out of five stars",0
The fit is great - makes me look like some kind of bodybuilding stud,1
Problem is it's near see-through,2
I mean you can see the color of my areola see-through,2
"In the summer when temps go up, I'm really afraid of being the unintentional star of the office wet t shirt contest",2
And I'm a man,0
I don't want,0
or need,0
that kind of attention to my manly chesticles,0
"So if you buy this shirt, you MUST wear a t shirt under it",2
"Great shirt , fits well, true to size",1
Everyone knows how these days it???hard to get a shirt that fits because the sizes don???seem to be standardized,2
This one is exactly the size that it says it is and looks very classy,1
Great value,1
"I have never purchased a Van Heusen shirt before, so I thought I'd give one a try",0
"I was looking for a wrinkle free, fitted, long sleeve dress shirt for work and that's what this was described to be",0
Sadly it's made of around 60% polyester and it shows,2
"""you get what you pay for",0
I won't be buying these shirts ever again,2
There are dress shirts out there that meet my needs that are made of all or mostly cotton which is what I prefer,0
Jos A banks makes a great fitted shirt and they have big sales all the time where you can get dress shirts for less $$$ than this one,1
It???a good fit,1
Stone gray is BLUE,2
Not what I wanted,2
"Size is great, their colors are off",1
"Attached is a picture of what a grey shirt should look like, and the shirt I was sold is gray",1
"I verified the tag inside the shirt, it was not miss-boxed, they don't know what GREY is",2
Unable to return,2
I really love this product I bought in a dark leaf color,1
"Fit is nice, material is worth the money my only comment has to be on the actual color of leaf and dark leaf itself",1
Both of these colors show up way differently on camera,0
So if these pictures are for a family picture event I'd suggest not purchasing as the color shows heavy blue tones,2
Wow,1
"For the price, it???a great value",1
Fits true to size and is a bit tapered at the waist,0
"The shirt is fine, and I understand that someone else may have tried it on before",0
Looks sloppy and makes me wonder if it???clean,1
"Cheap material and construction unlike any Van Heusen shirt I've ever owned, and I only buy Van Heusen",2
They are not wrinkle free as advertised,2
They feel like cheap knock offs,2
"By the time it was so torn I couldn't wear it, naturally the return window has closed",2
So after less than two months of very light wear I have a ripped shirt I can't wear any more,2
Otherwise liked fit/color,1
"So, it's actually a good product",1
"Here's the problem, the employee responsible for packing this product has either intentionally, or in a careless manner, positioned all the needles in a direction not akin to the norm, therefore pricking myself a few times",2
This shirt fits much better than his regular fit white shirts as he has lost quite a bit of weight and the regular fit are just so bulky and blousey when tucked into his slacks,1
This shirt is much more trim in the waistline and looks much better with his suits,1
"The shirt seems to be welll-made, too, although it has only been washed and worn once since he has had it for only a couple of weeks",1
A solid choice for the typical guy at a typical job,1
Comes out of the dryer fine,1
no need to iron,1
Picture is of a 15,0
"5, 32/33 shirt, on a 5'10"" 160lb male",0
Under shirt in picture is a standard Hanes white t-shirt,0
I ordered the fitted 15,0
5 36/37 shirt and my expectations were most certainly not met,2
Here are my biggest complaints:,2
#NAME?,0
which not every manufacture does,0
#NAME?,0
I'd estimate 38/39,0
#NAME?,0
I'm surprised by these discrepancies because I've had luck with Van Heusen before,0
Has quality control gone down?,2
"Nice and comfortable, definitely a value for the money",1
Fits as expected,1
"I had a couple of shirts custom tailored, to get that perfect fit look",1
"This shirt fits me almost exactly the same as those tailored shirts, without the ENORMOUS price of the tailoring",1
Even the fabric is a better than expected quality as well,1
Pros:,1
Fits to measurement,1
The french blue color is true to color,1
Well above average fabric for the price,1
First rate servie,1
Cons,2
I hate the shirts that come with the pins in them for packaging,2
"All in all, this shirt is an excellent buy, for the price, the fit and the color is a classic",1
This is the second Van Heusen shirt I've gotten with stains on it,2
It was still in its package and had the pins in it,2
"Either way, the grey shirt looks horrible",2
it looks that bad,2
The style is a bit of a tighter fit than I expected,2
"I'm 6'1"" and I wish the shirts were a few inches longer",2
some Van Heusen,0
that longer,0
I'd have thought that with a 17,0
"5"" neck, and a 35-37 inch sleeve length",0
they'd have been a bit longer,2
Oh well,0
The price is more than right,2
"Great shirt, fit nice, nice color",1
green,0
got lots of compliments at the office,1
will order more,1
Didn't wash yet so don't know how the wrinkle or shrinkage will be,0
Since buying this shirt I have tried their extra slim shirts and found them to fit better,1
less excess fabric around the middle,2
"on a 5'10"" 185lb frame",0
Problem I have with slim fit is the tightness around the chest area,2
I wear a 16 or 16,0
"5 Neck with 34'' to 35'' sleeves, and it was a great fit for me",1
"I could dance and move in this pretty easily, overall great shirt, especially the price",1
My sleeve length is 36/37,0
I bought 2 shirts,0
One fitted properly,1
"The other had very short sleeves, around 34 on the right and 35 on the left",2
I cannot return this item as I have already paid shipping to my country and local customs duties which is higher than the price of the shirt,2
"The neck fits me perfect, the rest of the shirt was gigantic on me",1
I have tried many of their shirts and can't find one to accommodate a larger neck with an average body build,2
Too late to return now,2
Nowhere in the product description is it indicated that it is a 2XL,2
I assumed therefire that it was a regular fit shirt,2
"4 stars for the shirt, zero for Amazon on this one",0
"By the time I opened it to wear it, the return period had ended",2
As another reviewer mentioned the sleeves are running short and this is a problem,2
I have been purchasing other brand 15,0
34/35,0
These brands trended towards the 34 length coming up short on arm length,2
Van Heusen has always been a quality product and still is,1
VH arm length are truly 34/35,0
Trending towards the longer 35 length,0
Great shirt,1
My next shirts will be Van Heusen even if the price is a little higher,1
"I have a 12"" spread between my chest diameter and waist diameter",0
and I have big shoulders,0
"maybe 1/2"" larger than I really need",2
and these shirts fit me perfectly,1
"If you lift weight or just have an athletic build, then these are the shirts to get",1
Bonus Points,1
They DON'T shrink in the wash,1
Clearly this is sized for a fat neck adolescent,0
Certainly not an adult man,2
And it is incredibly short,2
I'm 6 foot even and it barely reached my waist,2
Do not buy,2
"Oh, and the material looks pretty cheap too",2
we had to have them adjusted,2
the material was good though,1
I ordered for my skinny husband after double-checking his measurements,0
Fit like a dream,1
No bagging around the waist as some complained,1
The material is thinner,0
"No complaints with fit, price, or shirt in general",1
Delivery was on time and quick,1
"I'm 235 lbs and 6'2"", I ordered fitted size 18 36-37 sleeve",0
"All I got to say is, I feel sexy, ladies keep there eyes on me longer, my wife looks at me longer, and my dog Mercedes has been licking her chops and giving me a stare that could give a blind person a run for their money",1
"These shirts are hard to find, in my husbands neck size and slim fit, with a pocket",0
He has all these parameters,0
Lol nice shirts,1
"I have a ""portly"" build with short arms",2
"32-33""",0
", 18",0
"5"" collar, 42-44"" chest, 36"" waste",0
"For me, shirts generally have arm-length way too long, necks too tight, and are baggy",2
This shirt fits perfectly,1
"It is of fine workmanship, material, and cut",1
"There is excess ""ease"" at the joining of the back yoke to the back of the shirt that is very hard to keep from wrinkling",0
I bought the 18,0
5  36/37,0
The sleeves are at least 1??shorter than all my other shirts of that size,2
I???6????,0
I don???see shorter people with monkey length arms so not sure who this shirt was designed for,2
Don't see how these can be marketed as wrinkle free,2
Washed and put right into dryer,0
Took out at the end of cycle before the dryer stopped,0
Pulled the work shirts and put on a hanger,0
Wrinkled worse than any dress shirt I ever bought,2
"Bought based on Van Heusen "" lux sateen"" shirts I have",0
Those never wrinkle even when left in a ball in the laundry bag,1
Don't not buy unless you have a passion for ironing,2
"I purchased three of the ""Fitted"" shirts as I am an avid weightlifter with broad shoulders and a trim waist, and the cut is described as more of an ""athletic fit"" with a ""tapered waist",2
""" When I tried on one of these shirts I looked ridiculous as the shirt was way too large and in no way meant for a person with an athletic physique",2
I am tired of these companies and their vanity titling of clothing,0
As a woman I love a man-tailored shirt for me with some dark jeans,1
I just wish this one was softer,2
It's quite stiff even though I washed it,2
Prob will shop for an oxford type shirt,0
The shirt color is blotchy after one wash,2
Maybe this is a one off as I usually like this brand,2
Unfortunately I delayed in opening package and wearing shirt and Amazon now has only 1 month return policy-can???return,2
You can't beat these shirts,1
Love the tailored/slim fit and the option to get longer sleeves is perfect,1
Now I have high quality dress shirts at such an affordable price,1
"You can't beat this store and seller, they were so helpful with me returning a load of shirts so I could get the proper sleeve length",1
Definitely made a returning customer out of me,2
Ordered this shirt at the last minute for my wedding,0
Amazon delivered it reliably and in time,1
"Soft, expertly tailored shirt fits true to size",1
Looked great with my navy suit,1
Would buy more of these again,1
"It's a VahHusen, you can't go wrong",1
The sizing and fit are spot on correct for me at 16 1/2 Large,1
The shipping wrinkles iron right out and the shirt really looks good,1
I like the color and the fit was great,1
"The material was thinner than I expected, though wearing a long-sleeved dress shirt in the summer months, I don't see this as a dealbreaker",1
Would probably buy again,1
Seems like a fairly good quality shirt,1
I will definitely be buying this shirt from Van Heuson again,1
"Quality dress shirt comparable to most name brands, minus the high-end price tag",1
I'll be purchasing other colors in the future,1
PS I order several dress shirts from other companies on Amazon and none came even close to this shirt in terms of quality for this price level,1
I can't speak for the $35+ price range,1
I missed my return window so I'm going to have to donate it,2
Normally we are happy with this brand,1
I will not buy this style again,2
My fiance really loved the fit of this shirt,1
He had 1 other so we knew what size to order,0
He is tall,0
"6'2""",0
and muscular so I recommend ordering the longer sleeve length for those who are taller,2
"It's decent shirt for the money, the material isn't soft, it's fairly stiff, and it fits pretty large around the midsection, I'm athletic and for a fitted shirt it does not flatter the v taper",1
It's a fitted shirt,1
"A bit clearly wrinkled when it arrived, just from the folds",2
The shirt quality is a bit cheaper than I expected,2
"It still fit fine, actually, the fit was nearly perfect",1
"The quality of the shirt is where it suffers a bit, it's not very soft/comfortable, and would make prolonged wearing a bit difficult",2
Using the size charts I ordered what I thought would work - it is perfect,1
"Enough room in the chest on down to be comfortable, not enough shirt to bunch up or out",1
"He's asked if I would replace all his shirts with this style, it's a keeper",1
"Well made, well done Van Heusen",1
Bought for my son to wear to his graduation and he was VERY happy,1
Fit great and very comfy,1
Great price,1
sooo glad I order it,1
Much nicer than expected and fit very well,1
The anti wrinkle feature works well,1
"At a 40"" chest and 32"" waist, this was not as slim fit as I'd hoped",2
"I did like the quality of the material and construction, though",1
It really just depends on your build and how you like your shirts to fit,1
"The first shirt I purchased was charcoal, and when washing out the collar ended up with spots where the color bled out",2
"I purchased another as I liked the color, same exact thing",1
Compared to other brands which have not done the same these are poor quality,2
You get what you pay for,0
"My husband wears this very well, I bought two for him",1
Collar does not fit well,1
Thin material so you must wear an undershirt,2
"Wrinkles out of dryer, still must iron",2
Cannot insert metal collar stays,2
"It has the cheap, flimsy plastic collar stays sewn into the collar that cannot be removed",2
Will not buy again,2
I will stick with Charles Tyrwhitt,1
Beautiful color and exceptional quality,1
Washes up fabulously,0
"No fading, puckering, easy to spot press out the very few wrinkles that remained after washing",1
Absolutely love,1
I was amazed with how great with shirt was,1
"The packing was very solid, 6 pins holding the shirt in place",1
"It fit perfectly around my neck and wrists, and a great length",1
"The fit was good, just as I hoped",1
"It really does have a point collar, so it makes a tie look tidy",1
The fabric is a little scratchy just out of the package,2
I had hoped for a little softer,2
we'll see how it is when it comes back,0
"Overall, it seems like a good investment",1
Other fitted shirts I have tried recently pull apart at the chest when I put my hands on my hips--they obviously are cut incorrectly,0
This shirt is fine in that regard,1
"The price was appropriate, and the item arrived in good time",1
This shirt is not fitted,2
Puffy would be a better description,2
"Even though the shirt is baggy, the neck was too tight for the size marked",2
I???5??0?? 170lbs and I ordered my usual 15,0
5 32/33,0
I???fairly slim,0
It might make a good shirt for body builders,1
just order a size up in the neck,2
The shirt was tight around the arms and shoulders,2
"I???not huge, I have a 44??chest",0
I found that the arms were too tight around the seams and limited movement,2
"It is well made, out of quality fabric",1
My husband finds it comfortable and attractive,1
We are really happy with this purchase,1
These are good looking shirts and they fit me well,1
The price is also good,1
Here is a picture of the shirts after the first wash and light tumble dry,0
"The label inside the shirt says ""Steam Iron""",0
"Sleeves are way too baggy, not the look I was going for",2
as a result the entire shirt was very large,2
I will need to donate it,1
You'll have to clean up excess threads,2
"For that price, I didn't expect much of a finish, so no real disappointment",1
"If you're an everyday suit wearer and lose track of dry cleaning like I do, a few of these are a nice back up",1
Last minute purchase for a wedding,0
It was perfect,1
"Care info:  Wash the deep colors in cold, fluffed in dryer a few minutes then hung to dry completely",0
"Will need a quick ironing even though ""wrinkle free"" to make it look it's best",0
Husband loves these shirts,1
They fit well and are mostly wrinkle-free if you take them out of the dryer promptly,1
This is a very good shirt,1
Quality material,1
non of that thin fabric you can read through,0
The fitted version is tapered very well,1
Well worth this price,1
Unless you have the body of a black bear do not get the unfitted version,2
It will look like a blanket draped over you,2
The shirt fit way too tight,2
I buy other shirts of the same size with no fitting issues,1
Not at all like the old Van Heusen quality,2
The material had a weird feeling to it,2
Ordered about 10 different colors in the same size and they were all perfect,1
My husband already knew his size so it worked out perfect,1
Had this shirt still wrapped up in a drawer for back up,0
Unwrapped it last night and realized it had been sliced across the middle,2
Looks like it was a box cutter when unpacking,2
Quality checks need tightening up,2
I'm a tall dude,0
"6'3""",0
The sleeves were too short,2
I took a guess on my sleeve length and 34/35 ended up fitting very well,1
I had to knock off a star because the wrinkles are hard to get out,2
"Drying, steaming, and ironing barely got all of the wrinkles",2
I now know to just go straight to the dry cleaners next time,0
Basic white dress shirt arrived promptly and neatly packaged,2
Ordered a satin finish shirt as well and decided to keep that one instead,1
Love these shirts,1
"These are a staple of my closet, as they are well made and very comfortable",1
The fitted style is perfect if you want a tailored look without the cost of a tailor??딆텗t so baggy,1
I love them so much I ordered multiples,1
great selection of colors,1
"Not slim fit, not even close",2
This shirt is perfect for me,1
Fits very well - true to size - and the color is accurate,1
"It???a pale green color, not necessarily lime per say",2
Will be ordering more,1
This shirt was just what I was looking for,1
"If you are Van Heusen lover like myself, you would know that even though this is a slim fit shirt it's still fits a little bit bigger",1
Been using these shirts and changing ties for over 10 years,1
I have gone through at least 30 shirts,0
I just get rid of them every year due to ring around the color,0
I don???think it is the shirts fault,0
Van Huesen is a great brand,1
I like that they switch things up too,1
Most of their stuff is real decent and durable quality,1
The collar on this shirt is small,2
The material is coarse and the collar rubs the neck causing slight soreness,2
It is not wrinkle resistant,2
"Otherwise, fit was okay",1
"The color is a blue tone grey, not a true grey, so be careful of that",2
It???an easy material to care for,1
We flew to Ohio for a wedding,0
My husband forgot to pack a dress shirt,0
We had this one sent to us where we were staying,0
It was perfect,1
It was tighter than expected  Had return for a size bigger  When I received the lager size could not be any happier  Great shirt  Suggest order two sizes and returning the one that doesn???please,2
i found one of these at a yard sale over a year ago and tried it for work,0
they last forever and take a beating,1
so i looked up the exact shirt and size on amazon and bought some more,0
"I bought this shirt in a 15 1/2 neck, fitted style",0
It is suited to fit big men's sizes,1
"I've never seen a shirt so very mismarked, missized, and misleading",2
Stay away,2
The material is very nice,1
Unfortunately I returned it and Amazon lost track of my return,2
It would be nice if there was a way to report this thing by phone or email,2
Great product,1
"Good price, really nice fit, the fabric is light enough to make the shirt perfect for warm weather",1
New shirt arrived in used condition,2
horribly wrinkled,2
Shirt is very tight in the shoulders relative to other fitted shirts of the same dimensions,2
Yes this is the fitted shirt my husband wears to work,0
I hate removing all the pins,2
Just had to get that out,2
Pins are a pain,2
This custom must stop,2
Didn't feel very slim fitting as expected,1
36/37,0
", so there's some ridiculous bunching above the elbows",2
Also the fabric is much more translucent than expected,1
Avoid bright lights if you don't want to expose yourself,2
Returning,2
This shirt is way too big I weigh 145 and I ordered a small this is super large and the thing about it is it won't fit around my neck I'll give it to one of my fat cousins it's a defected shirt that all just not put together right,2
The shirt seems fine,1
I purchased it as a gift for my son,0
The cardboard inserts and the cardboard that goes in the color were just out and the shirt had just been bottled up and thrown into the bag,0
"A great long sleeve, wrinkle free dress shirt that I would recommend to anyone",1
As an Inexpensive Dress Shirt I have to give it 5??멥돘???1,1
"Looks Good,BFeels Good, Launders Well",1
Was afraid of it being fitted,0
I'm still a little heavy,0
The color is perfect,1
"I have other ""large"" shirts and there is no standard",0
Some end up tight with t rex sleeves,2
This has orangutan sleeves,2
Fits like a garbage bag,1
You get what you pay for,0
Fit is okay and it looks okay,1
Nothing special,2
This was a reorder because my husband loved the shirt for work the first time we ordered it,1
This time it wasn't the same shirt,0
It has a satiny texture with pinstripes throughout and sent with cuff links,0
Unclear as to why I ordered it one time and it was one way and the next different,2
"This shirt is really, really long",2
I would recommend it for six-footers and above,1
The sleeves are also rather baggy,2
The fabric is also a little stiff,2
normal for poplin,0
and is not exactly wrinkle-free,2
Really like these fitted style shirts,1
"I'm broader in the chest and shoulders than in the gut and waist, so the taper prevents the blooming effect when I tuck them in",2
Great for athletic build,1
"The slim style is for skinny guys with slimmer chest, shoulders, neck and arms",1
I go through these shirts in about 6 months,0
I have a desk job and always have to wear these so they are washed often,0
"As a result, after about 6 months your elbow will tear through",2
I can just replace the same color of just get another one,0
"Shipped to the house, how can you complain",0
Note these are everyday shirts,1
If you have an expensive suit or the like I would get a Jos,1
Bank,0
Bought if for a one-shot appearance,1
Fit perfect and solved the problem,1
I have 9 or 10 of these shirts,0
"Fit is great, easy to clean, and solid construction for a good price",1
I have a bunch of their black dress shirts too,0
"Van Heusen is a good company, and I usually restock these shirts every couple months, as I go through them quickly",1
"Security job, I use and abuse these shirts and they still look great, so me needing new ones every couple months is not an issue",1
This is a utilitarian shirt for the price,0
You get what you pay for,0
"If you picked thewlis shirt out based off your measurements and it didint fit you right, then you dont know your measurements and I suggest you measure yourself again",2
Fits like a glove for me,1
"This shirt is 65% polyester, and the color is more green than pictured",2
Nice fabric and tailored,1
I didn't know what to expect when I bought this shirt for my husband,0
This shirt was definitely not too tight,2
"If you/your spouse has a bit of a belly, I would not recommend this shirt",2
"I feel it would be too tight and accentuate the ""beer belly""",2
"As for the material, it was very easy to clean",1
"My husband works in the food industry and even with BBQ sauce on the sleeves, it came out nice and clean",1
For what it cost,0
really excellent,1
I recommend emphatically,1
I recently got a Brooks Brothers fitted shirt of the same size and it fit me perfectly,1
It is not good for a man with extra around the middle,2
I was pretty disappointed and had to send it back,2
"In this case, I think I'd just have to say that you get what you pay for",0
"Great fit for athletic build with larger shoulders/chest and tapered waist, so there's not a ton of extra material at the waist like with regular fit shirts",1
The shirts wash well and don't require ironing,1
Excellent price,1
We bought many,0
Wish there were more colors/styles,2
Nice color and quality,1
This is a gift so will re rate once given,1
Van Heusen is still providing high quality shirts that fit great as long as you measure correctly and look great as well,1
I am happy with the one I purchased and feel like I got great value for my money,1
"Perfect size, well made shirt",1
I normally order shirts a half dozen to a dozen at a time,0
These were a very good value,1
I am tired of getting clothes that were returned by other members,2
I don???need their germs in my house,0
These shirts fit perfectly every time and they're super easy to iron,1
I have no reason to buy another type of shirt,1
They also have plenty of colors and look high end,1
Good shirt for $21,1
"Have had the shirt for over a month, and it has held up well, so pretty solid construction",1
Have used with a suit &amp,0
"tie, and without, and it looks fine with both",2
The size fits well,1
I wouldn't pay more than the $21 I spent for a shirt of this quality material,2
I always buy Van Heusen shirts because they really are wrinkled free once you wash them,1
Love this shirt,1
"Ordered from Amazon, arrived in a couple of days and exceeded expectations",1
Received praise from co-workers as to how cool it looked,1
I have ordered two additional shirts since this order,0
Will buy again in future,1
"Even though the neck is short for me, the fit of the shirt is perfect",1
I guess is my fault for having an odd body and a chubby neck,2
I like the feel of the shirt because it fits the way a shirt supposed to fit,1
Also the length is great,1
I wear shirt stays and no problems there,0
Over all I will be buying more,1
I love this shirt,1
It will look quite nice with a grey suit,1
I am a generally skinny fellow with a dusting of muscle and this shirt fits really well for that type of build,1
I also love the color,1
Basically this shirt if perfect for the daily grind and it perfect if you are relatively fit/ skinny,1
"very good shirt, i got a 15 1/2 32-33",1
"I knew the  sleeves where not going to be very long, I need to order a 33-34",0

"for the price is great too, can be use as a dress shirt",1
I ordered an 18 1/2 and 36/37 for my husband who is 6 fit four,0
The shirt was thinner and shorter than I expected,1
Usually when I order this size shirt it fits big on my husband,2
This one is tough to stay tucked in for him because he is so tall,2
Not sure if it is because it is fitted,0
He is not fat just tall and it needed to be about two inches longer to have that perfect fitted look for him,2
Great fit,1
Best sized shirt I own by far,1
I don???think you can get any better for the price point,1
"I purchased two shirts in a 17 inch neck, 36-37 inch sleeves",0
My best guess,1
"I am 6'5"" and I have to remember to not bend over or to the side or the shirt becomes untucked",2
Why shirts would be sold with very long sleeves and an abnormal length is beyond my understanding,2
Maybe a monkey or ape was the fitting model,2
Very nice shirt if you get the right size,1
which I didn???at first,0
Made in Bangladesh,1
Slim fit still isn???very slim,1
The material seems good,1
Quality is good,1
Overall it???a great purchase,1
In order to continue to wear this,0
an other similar shirts,0
I will have to buy those t-shirts with extra padding in the pit area,0
"Otherwise, Van Heusen does it well",1
Can't blame them for me having no idea what poplin is or how my pits will look until after wearing it,0
"I am a pretty husky man, and this shirt is still baggy",2
"It's a lot sloppier and larger than I expected for a ""fitted shirt",1
""" It is worth noting that the fabric is thin, for your information -- that could be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on what you're seeking",1
Many compliments at work with the vibrant color,1
"and of course, the tailored fit on my body",1
fit smaller/tighter than the same size hanging in my closet,2
Had to return it,2
"Perfect shirt, probably the most attractive dress shirt I have",1
I love the shade of blue for this shirt,1
Fits just as it should so order it in your size,1
I enjoy the quality of Van Heusen shirts as they look like you paid way more than you did for them,1
This shirt helps me to look like I make more money than I do and I am frequently complimented on this shirt,1
I will and have since purchase more of this company's shirts,1
Note: their pants are good too,1
This shirt was a great fit and looked great with my husbands suit,1
I really enjoy these shirts for work,1
Good fit &amp,1
consistent sizing,2
"This is a regular-cut shirt, not fitted at all",2
"Other than that, the shirt is perfect - low price, wrinkle resistant, light material, and good colors",1
Slim fit and super comfortable,1
Ordered these shirts and they fit perfect,1
One had a small smudge on it and appeared to have been tried in or maybe even worn for a day,2
Sending it back for a replacement,2
No biggie,0
This shirt fits my boys great,1
Van Heusen makes high quality shirts and buying them online allowed me to pay less than I would have in the brick and mortar stores,2
Amazon also carried this shirt in the size/style that was not available in the stores I shopped at,1
I ended up sending them back and purchasing the Van Heusen,0
small little gray stain on one elbow,2
i wear a coat so i can live with it,0
look closely,0
shirt fits perfect and looks good-i am very satisfied,1
This shirt fits well in the shoulders if you need a more athletically cut shirt that doesn't feel like a tent in the torso area,1
The problem I have with this shirt is that it's too short,2
"I am 6'1"" and this shirt comes untucked constantly throughout the day",2
"If they could just give it a little more length, my search for the perfect shirt would be over",1
Unfortunately I would not buy this again,2
I will be returning,2
It was also pretty see-through,2
Love the shirt,1
Slim fit XXL fits like a XL,2
Otherwise it would be perfect,1
The Van Heusen shirt looked okay yet when I put it on it was much too small and I put it on my bed,2
"My daughter does laundry for the family and she noticed the shirt over the end of the bed and thought it needed washing? Oh well, it's a little smaller",2
after the wash and dry cycles,0
"Oh well, I can't return it in this condition, will turn it into a DUST RAG",2
I bought the 14 1/2??- 32/33 fitted for my nearly 15 year old,0
Looks like a quality shirt and held up to washing and ironing well,1
Doesn???look thin or cheap,2
"Just as described, perfect fit and arrived on time",1
I bought this shirt for my husband as a Christmas gift and he is very happy with it,1
"He wears a Medium shirt and has a 32"" waist, and he very much dislikes the way regular-fit shirts balloon out on him",1
this one fits him perfectly,1
"I am definitely returning this shirt to Amazon, which is rare for me",2
Pros:,1
Fits well,1
Cons:,2
"The collar stays are not removable, and they are very flexible",0
the one on the collar,0
"Very thin material, no insulation value",2
"Despite being called ""fitted"", this shirt is very baggy around my torso",2
Van heusen shirts are consistent with their sizing,0
It's been years since I last bought these shirts,0
"The ones that I recently received fit like the ones before, perfectly",1
"The fit is great for me -- especially when considering that I have a 16-1/2"" neck, a 34"" waist, a 36"" sleeve &amp",1
"am 6'-3"" tall",0
"This ""Fitted"" shirt that was made with a perfect neck size &amp",1
sleeve length for me is WONDERFUL,1
Buena calidad y excelente material,1
Fits as expected,1
"Fitted shirt, stays tucked, crisp look, collars has built in stays",1
Very nice,1
I bought 5,0
The van heusen mens fitted dress shirt was a great purchase for me,1
It looks and fits well,1
It irons out well and holds a crease,1
The material is the right thickness,1
If you want a good dress shirt that looks good for half the price of the ones at the department store then you will like this shirt,1
I have not washed the shirt because I am fearful that the shirt will shrink,2
We had a problem with this order from the start,2
First the order arrived with the package slightly opened so I could almost see the product inside,2
Then when my husband went to wear it it had what appeared to be a burn stain on the front chest,2
Unfortunately he had to wear it to the party we were attending bc it was part of a costume,2
My husband threw it away afterwards,2
This shirt fits great and the dark green color is impossible to find locally,1
My son wears a 17 and it fit him perfectly,1
"Material was thin, just not the quality of my other Van Heusen shirts",2
People at work say ??nice shirt??except one guy,1
he said,0
???뭓t???actually not a very nice shirt,2
I don???know why people always say nice shirt,2
??And I said ???know right?,0
??I haven???worn it sense,0
Shirt is nice,1
Looks good and irons nicely,1
The Arrow 1851 is on Amazon for $17,0
This is a knockoff brand,2
The material feels like plastic,1
We returned all three colors we ordered,2
"These are fitted shirts, so they were going to be tight",2
That was fine,1
My problem was the material was scratchy and thin,2
"Not only that, it did not feel very breathable",2
"I couldn't imagine myself wearing this shirt all day, especially in the heat",0
Had to return it,2
"Way too tight, especially for a B &amp",2
"Returned it, thank you Amazon for a great return policy on clothing",1
Disappointed,2
Love it,1
Great product at a great price,1
Thank you,1
I buy a lot of fitted dress shirts and usually go with a classic fit or big fit,0
It fit more like a slim fit shirt,1
Bought this for my husband for a Christmas Day photo shoot and the pocket was sliced up when I received it,2
"Here we are, 3 days away from Christmas and no time to order a new one",0
Great shirt,1
Fit great and very nice,1
Way better price than in department stores,1
I love Van Heusen Men's Poplin fitted solid point collar dress shirt,1
It fit my son perfectly and he liked the shirt as well,1
I would order from them again,1
This is no slim fit,2
it is much too wide,2
The sleeves also are too long,w2
"I bought 16 neck, 34/35 sleeve",0
"I'm 5'6"", I weigh about 170lbs, and my arms are long",0
I needed a shirt that fits my large neck and short arms without paying a high price,0
This is an excellent buy for those on a budget,1
"Not really a slim-fit, although a bit less fabric than standard dress shirts",2
Don't even think about this shirt unless you plan to wear it with an undershirt--fabric is see-through,2
????only issue was that it was not as dark/black as it shows on the photo,2
It???kinda a bit of a light black when shined under a well lit room which is where my work place is in retail stores,1
"I???much rather get the Stafford Dress Shirts, now those are truly the dark slick shirts I was expecting from this brand??,
Van Heusen shirt fit as expected,
Great Shirt,
Love Van Heusens,
The 18 neck fits like a 17,
5",2
The shirt is great for wearing under a suit,1
It has a chest pocket and the collar is good quality,1
Perfect fit,1
No loose threads unlike some others I've purchased at this price,1
Good material not thin and cheap,1
Professional attire quality will be buying more,1
Nice dress shirt/ color was spot on,1
I am 6 ft tall,0
182cm,0
and this shirt keeps coming out of my pants,2
I go back to Stafford,0
I'm very pleasantly surprised by how well these fit,1
"I have a large neck, and chest, so most shirts like this in my size are absolutely huge around the waist",1
"It's such a nice fit, that I'm sending back a different shirt that I just bought, and replacing it with more of this one in some more colors",1
Great shirt,1
Bought more than a half dozen of these shirts and they've been excellent,1
Really nice fitted shirt,1
I love the color I purchased,1
All in all a great value,1
Very comfortable shirt,1
"I'm 6'5 and about 225 lbs, and the xl fits very comfortably",1
I'll buy more of these shirts in the future,1
You really can't beat this price,1
I wear this shirt pretty frequently and there's no holes or rips in it yet so i'd say it's good quality too,1
Shirt looks and fits really well,1
Very nice to look at,1
Not happy,2
"it great simple no fuss dress shirt, it is truly wrinkle free",1
I am so glad I found these,1
So pissed when Kohl???stopped carrying ??利쐔ted??shirts,2
I will be ordering more,1
"Normally, a 15 1/2 is too tight for me, and a 16 feels comfortable",2
"despite being ""fitted""",2
it's far too wide lower down,2
"Admittedly, that was expected, since the sizing chart had informed me that a 16 neck would accommodate up to a 39 waist, and my waist is 31",1
"I don't see, though, how such a shirt could claim to be ""fitted",2
"Still, it's good quality for the price, and I would consider buying it again a size down",1
at a 15 1/2,0
I bought this shirt for my husband and he really liked it,1
The color was perfect,1
"36-37""",0
", the tail could be longer",2
does not stay tucked in very well,1
"I am 6'1"", 48 chest, 36 waist",0
"The length of the shirt is far to short, constantly comes untucked",2
"And I???average build, 5??1, 190 pounds",0
"The shirts also to wide on the sides and sleeves, very billowing and loose fitting",2
This shirt is perfect because it looks nice and it is inexpensive,1
I took one star off because the fabric isn't amazing,2
It feels a little stiff and starchy,2
This shirt *almost* was what I wanted,1
"For me, it came untucked in the back several times throughout the day",2
Disappointed in the quality of this shirt,2
When sewing the hem at the bottom of the shirt they missed a section of material,2
It just hangs there with loose threads and looks terrible,2
I'll have to fix it myself,2
A quality check of any kind would have and should have caught the problem,2
I'll be looking for another brand with my next purchase,2
El cuello  demasiado  peque筌?퍓,0
I bought this for my son and it could not have fit him any better,1
"Great quality, great price, great fit",1
Nice dress shirt for the price,1
Really appreciate it not being baggy,1
A little bit too large in the sleeves,2
Its okay just not the greatest dress shirts out there,1
Husband loves these for work,1
Great shirt and high quality,1
"5 stars for QUALITY, LOOK, FITTING &amp",1
PRICE for the Van Heusen's Fitted Shirts,1
Fits like a glove,1
I like fitted better than regular,0
and can't beat the $20 cost per shirt,1
I wish they had more colors though,2
Shirt: 15-1/2 ?? neck-wrong,0
16 ??neck-yes,0
"Dirty-grease, etc",2
"I wear a not-too-common size, 18"" neck x 32-33"" sleeve, and I chose Amazon's free shipping, so this took a month to get here",0
I have to say that it was worth the wait,1
My shirt fits me perfectly and appears to be very well constructed,1
"I have always been satisfied with Van Heusen shirts, and this is no exception",1
I will definitely buy this shirt again when the need arises,1
I'm 5'9 and weight 215lbs with wide shoulders and muscular build,0
Most dress shirts look awful on me because the shoulders are super tight on them and wait looks baggy and out of proportion,0
This is the first shirt I've worn in a long time that fits me very well,1
Kind of like a slim fit that you can wear to work and still look professional,1
Only downside is that the fabric is very thin,2
So if you're wearing an undershirt? you can clearly see it under the dress shirt,2
"Solid shirt for 20 bucks, just ordered 5 more",0
I'm giving it 3 stars it's okay for the price requires a little ironing works well with a suit since I have many dress shirts I don't have to wear it often so it's a good bargain,1
Material is really uncomfortable,2
"the Goodthreads line is much better, in my opinion",1
Or any of the Kenneth Cole poplin shirts,0
"this is really, exceedingly uncomfortable material",2
"Too bad, they are very nice looking shirts",1
Was a little to tight,2
im 6 foot tall 175 pounds and finding a shirt nowadays that I am not swimming in is tough,0
"This one is great, nice fit, good materials and good build quality, I ended up buying two",1
"Purchased an 18"" neck 34"" sleeve fitted shirt",0
"High quality material, comfortable to wear and looks sharp",1
Washes and irons easily,1
I am short and stocky,0
"5'5""",0
with a thick neck,0
"with me, the shirt has a neck that's good for me",1
"18""",0
hence the loss of star,0
", it's still a very good professional shirt",1
"I have other shirts that are 18"" fitted that have a better cut and fit than this shirt so I have some idea of what to expect",0
"As a plain white shirt, it's perfect for business or business casual",1
a sport coat and no tie,0
Looks sharp under a jacket,1
"Van Heusen is a brand with a long history, so I feel better about buying this shirt over a no-name shirt",1
Will probably buy more shirts,1
love the color,1
which is exactly the picture,1
thinner does not block wind,0
which is great for CA or wamer climate,1
Again this shirt was my second one to replace the prior  mis-sized one This one was a 3x and it went on like a large Not close to being a 3x My normal size is a 2x,2
great color and fit,1
Stiff as a board came wrinkled and at the last minute big disappointment I would not recommend buying this product,2
"Its a dress shirt, so it does what its supposed to",0
I have found after a couple washes that its getting too short,2
Its starting to come untucked during the day which is very disappointing,2
Its a kind of a rough material as well,2
Thats a catch 22,0
This is a great dress shirt,1
"I bought it in red for the holidays, and I received many compliments",1
Van Heusen's quality is several notches above the rest too,1
The fit is perfect,1
I wouldn't hesitate to purchase more of these shirts in other colors,1
This is the smooth feeling shirt,1
I love the way it look with my suit,1
Thanks,1
Very nice shirt,1
Good stitching,1
"I'm 6'1"" 185lbs, slim, and the 16-32/33 fit me perfectly",1
My husband is completely satisfied with this shirt,1
"Thanks to others' reviews, I purchased this shirt because he wanted a light-weight, professional, basic white shirt to wear with a suit",0
Thank you,1
"Washed before wearing it in cold water, used tide as a detergent and no color Clorox",0
Color faded inside of collar,2
there is little material to tuck in,2
not for tall people,2
Best value around,1
"Update:  I found that after ironing these shirts, now when I wash them they come out of the dryer wearable",0
I have owned a number of Van Heusen shirts I bought 3 or 4 years ago that I have been very satisfied with,1
Those ones were truly wrinkle free,1
"Take them out of the dryer, give them a snap, hang them up and you're good to go",0
Not the case with the two I just purchased,0
"I understand that a ""wrinkle free"" shirt will never be the same as a freshly pressed or ironed shirt, so that wasn't my expectation",2
"I have washed them four times so far, and have tried four different methods of drying them",0
"I tried taking them out totally dry, mostly dry, somewhat dry, and right out of the washer having just been tumbled for about 60 seconds in the dryer",0
"I took them straight out of the dryer, gave them a snap, and hung them up",0
In every instance they come out too wrinkled to wear,2
I gave these shirts a one-star review because they are useless to me,2
"I didn't buy these to bum around on the weekends, I bought them to wear to work, and I simply can't do so",2
"I would not purchase these shirts again, nor recommend them to anyone",2
Beautifully made shirt,1
A wedding shirt for my son in law,0
Thankfully I have been able to find these shirts which fit perfectly and feel nice,1
The price is also great so I am able to have plenty of these on hand whenever needed,1
Overall it's a decent shirt for a good price,1
My primary concern is it's fit,2
"It doesn't resemble ""Fitted"" at all in my opinion",2
The fit is insignificantly different from a standard fit shirt,2
This seems to be how Van Heusen shirts are,0
they are bigger than most other shirts despite the same sizing,2
It's not a big deal for me since I'll never wear it without a coat to hide it's ill fit on me,0
"If you are a fellow with a larger torso, then this shirt should fit you quite well",1
"If you are a slimmer person like myself, I recommend looking elsewhere",2
These shirts fit just right,1
I have a 17,0
"5"" neck, a 46"" chest, and 35 inch sleeve length",0
I'm kind of a fireplug with a sharp vee in my back,0
so finding shirts that fit me without looking like a potato sack is a hard job,0
These fit JUST RIGHT,1
"I get them with a 1/2"" extra in the neck so I don't feel strangled and they still look really sharp",1
"the sleeve length is perfect, and they don't have a lot of excess material when I tuck them into my trousers",1
it is a nice fit for folks who lift weights or just naturally have wide shoulders,1
GREAT SHIRT,1
Bought the size I'd normally buy in store and it fits the same,1
"Perfect fit, neck and sleeve",1
"The shirt looks great too no flaws, no loose stitching",1
Not accurate sizing,2
"Bought for 14 year old son, who wanted PLAIN for his mandatory band concert shirt",0
I would buy this again,1
"and probably will, when the next one hits high school",0
#NAME?,0
Great product,1
"I have Van Heusen purchased from a physical location, all with the exact dimensions, and they all fit the same exact way",1
"So I decided to purchase this with choosing the same dimensions again, and the sleeves are too long",2
I don't even understand how that happens,2
This is one make of shirt that I never regret buying,2
The size chart does not work well for big and tall guys had to return this item,2
good value,1
sleeves are 'fitted' with little extra room,1
no me gusto mucho la tela ya que es muy fina y se ve atravez y en las mangas de los brazos esta muy ancha,0
"pedi una small la mas pequna 5,8pies 159lbs",0
Not wrinkle free,2
Buena calidad,0
"Comfortable, great fit",1
less extra bag then regular fit,2
I got a fitted shirt that fits like a hot air balloon,2
I am relatively thin,0
Beware,0
I don't return it because I don't want to get on Amazon's black list,2
Had to purchase specifically for a wedding party or the Groom,1
Van Heusen shirts are all I buy now,1
They hold up well to physical work and look great doing it,1
I'm 6' and 180lbs,0
I find the 16 34/35 to be a great fit,1
Muy bien aun un poquito duro el material,0
Excellent quality,1
Perfect fit,1
I definitely will buy more,1
Great quality esp for the price,1
bought on sale,0
Still happy with the purchase,1
"This shirt is advertised as ""FITTED"" and it is far from that",2
"The body of the shirt is huge, almost like a potato sack",2
The sleeves are as large in diameter as the legs of pants,0
This shirt is horribly cut,2
"Do not buy if you are expecting a FITTED or even a ""classic"" cut dress shirt",2
Great color,1
Fits well,1
"Although it is not a slim fit, it fits with out too much at the middle",2
"I was so happy to find 18 by 32/33 size, unfortunately it's way too baggy on upper body and sleeves",2
I guess this is mostly a note for myself to stop buying shirts online,2
This is a standard white dress shirt,0
It is fitted and fits me well,1
The neck is just the perfect size along with the length of the arms,1
The shirt presses out well and holds it for a long time,1
I have not washed the shirt yet as I am fearful it may shrink,2
"Overall this is a good deal, better than spending 50 bucks for a dress shirt at a department store",1
These are great shirts,1
They fit exactly as expected,1
I have longer arms than most and they still fit fine,1
The slim fit makes it so I don't have to wear my shirt stays if I don't want to,1
Thanks for making me look sharp without breaking the bank,1
I bought this shirt for my husband and it fit him nicely,1
I like the cut and the fabric seems to be of good quality,1
We'll see how it holds up with washing,0
"After buying other dress shirts from Amazon and having to return them because of poor fit, these are perfect",0
"Fit nice, seem like good quality",1
Will buy more,1
This shirt fits perfectly,1
Love the color,1
Will definitely buy more of this brand,1
These shirts are awesome,1
"They look good on hubs, wash and dry well, and at a great price",1
"I bought the white, gray, and tan",0
Grreat value for the money,1
Nice fit,1
Great shirt,1
Not so bad,0
I like this,1
Aqu筌?les pongo la foto de c筌ｌ겕o vino la camisa,0
He comprado varias camisas en Amazon y es la primera vez que me viene una as筌?,0
"Estoy en Ecuador, recib筌?el producto ayer, lo estoy haciendo devolver para que les llegue la pr筌ｌ겥ima semana",0
"Por cierto es 1 sola de las dos camisas negras que voy a devolver, el cr筌?렀ito aparece por las 2 camisas y es solo una que voy a devolver",0
Fits perfect,1
Love this shirt,1
Get lots of compliments,1
Great,1
"I'm struggling to get the initial folds out without an iron, I suspect this thing doesn't wrinkle too much",1
All of the men in our wedding party wore these shirts and I loved them,1
Nice quality and color,1
Excellent,1
A little big for a fitted shirt,2
Basically shear material if your into that,2
The collar seemed oddly thick to me,2
Not my style,2
I purchased this shirt for work purposes,0
I am food and beverage and I go through many white shirts due to stains,0
"This shirt is great because the material is wrinkle free, stains come out well, and the fit is perfect",1
I am skinny with long arms and it fits perfectly,1
Just purchased another after testing the product,2
Says wrinkle free,0
It???not,0
"I ironed, starch",2
Threw in dryer and wrinkles wouldn???come out,1
The shirt is terrible,2
The only thing Van Heusen shirts have going for them is that they're cheap,2
"On the other hand, if you're pretty overweight and always keep your sleeves rolled up then this is an excellent shirt",1
We do not have a good clothing store,2
"I absolutely love the availability of quality well packaged, nice fitting shirts via Amazon",1
Now I can look like me and not like everyone else in town sporting off the rack clone wear,0
Fits perfect,1
Great quality will buy different colors in the future,1
For the price its well worth it,1
Comfort,1
Definitely not wrinkle free,2
"Due to the shirt being %65 polyester, it needs to be worn and washed a few times before it softens up and takes on more of a cotton shirt appearance",2
Husband felt comfortable,1
Sleeves just a very tiny bit short,2
He liked how it looks and feels,1
"Compared to the other shirts I have of the same size, Grey Stone was a different material, tags were different, and the proportions were off making the sleeves too small",2
The chest fit really good,1
"I thought it looked really nice, good quality, etc",1
The arms were just too baggy for me,2
"Great purchase, materials great, husband is very happy",1
Thin fabric,0
Fits perfect for my ample size and the sleeves are the perfect length,1
If you measure an 18 neck get the 18,0
Just what I needed for my new tuxedo,1
The fitted style eliminates all that extra fabric around the waist,0
It also has not yet been to the cleaners,0
"Runs very small,  went to store bought one same size and wore it instead",2
Not a fitted shirt,2
"Says fitted both in description and on collar, fits like a prince shirt from 1986",0
Would not buy again,2
"Love the color, Hate the point collar",0
"would prefer a little more spread, not wide, just a little more spread",2
Can't seem to find it online anywhere,2
Shirt is a poor fit and irregularly cut,2
This product and the price is out of this world,1
"It look good, feel good, and you can't beat the price",1
Amazon is my home for life,0
Great shirt,1
Van Heusen shirts are the next best thing to Jos A Bank or the Men's Warehouse,1
The last two are a total tie,2
"So, I love it",1
"Again, Amazon is going to have a lot of trouble getting rid of me as a customer",0
Good qualit,1
Love these shirts,1
"Great feel, crispness and darkness",1
black,0
Holds the color through many washes,1
I use these every weekend this they get washed weekly,1
He loves the fit &amp,1

Gorgeous color,1
Good value,1
Solid basic dress shirt to hold in your wardrobe,0
Weird  fit way too narrow  at the hips,2
This shirt fits great and looks better,1
High quality for a great price characteristic of Van Heusen products,1
These are my husband's favorite dress shirt,1
So they are worn a lot,2
These hold up well and fit his long torso very well,1
"Also, I can dry them without them shrinking",1
Yay,0
"Some slight modeling discoloration on back of shirt, not really noticeable unless inspecting the shirt closely under bright light",0
Nothing that prevents me from wearing the shirt,1
Usually worn under a jacket,0
Nice quality,1
Fits my son perfect based on sizing of existing JCPENNEY dress shirts,1
I have purchased this shirt twice and will probably again,1
"It doesn't wrinkle in the dryer, fits well and looks good",1
The fitted size hangs well without being too tight,1
Will likely buy again,1
Very nice shirt,1
I'm happy,1
I guess just know your size,0
Especially for 20 bucks,0
Lower quality that I am used to from Van Heusen,2
Purchased three of these and will probably have them tailored,1
"I have purchased these for many years, yet I???not fully satisfied",0
"Very nice shirt I bought it for my teen son, he wore a black under shirt with this shirt tucked in and with a tie",1
Great fit and quality shirt for the price,1
Significantly smaller than any of them,2
"Also, should change from ??毓칒nkle free??to ??毓쫖l wrinkle as you put it on??,
Will not make the mistake of purchasing again,
A nicely made light dress shirt for a great price,
Washes well and is very comfortable,
I have purchased many,
I would recommend,
Fit my husband's athletic build well,
Great looking shirt,
I did not like that it had the cheap built in collar stays which eventually get damaged,
I strongly prefer Wurkin Stiffs magnetic collar stays which require a """"pouch"""" in the collar in which to place the stays""",2
Other than that,0
A nice shirt,1
I recommend purchasing this item,1
Great looking shirt,1
I did not like that it had the cheap built in collar stays which eventually get damaged,2
"I strongly prefer Wurkin Stiffs magnetic collar stays which require a ""pouch"" in the collar in which to place the stays",1
Other than that,0
A nice shirt,1
I recommend purchasing this item,1
I just needed a white shirt for a specific event and tried this one,0
Shirt fit well and was surprisingly made well,1
Will buy this shirt in different colors as I need them,1
"Perfectly, shipped and items fitted as requested",1
"These shirts are great for work, I literally own every color",1
They fit great and they won???fade if you take them to get dry cleaned,1
Good looking well-constructed shirt,1
Unfortunately the built-in collar stays become obvious after a number of washings,2
Not very professional looking after that,2
"Great value, fit and look",1
Baggy,2
Arms are baggy chest and back have tons of slack,2
Its a clown shirt,2
I bought this shirt for Valentine's Day,0
"It looks so good and fits so well, I will wear it many more times",1
Very nice fit,1
great price,1
Hard to find 18,2
"5, 32/33 so I was glad to find this shirt",1
You will need to iron it,2
Arrived very wrinkled and took a bit of work to dewrinkle,2
Put in dryer and when shirt is slightly damp hit it with an iron,2
Oh after washing there were more than a few bits of thread hanging from seams,0
Had to trim,2
I ordered the 15 1/2 neck with the 34-35 sleeve,0
Medium,0
I ordered the shirt for my husband for our maternity shoot and it fit and looked great,1
Very pleased,1
Great look for the price,1
Excellent shirt hands down for the price,1
Nice Dress Shirt,1
Van Heusen quality as usual,0
No issues or complaints,1
"Description says wrinkle free, they are not wrinkle free",2
I like to dress nice on a budget and these VH dress shirts do both well,1
Easy to iron,1
yes I iron everything,0
hold up very well and they're inexpensive to replace,1
I've worn this brand for years and always come back,1
I love this shirt,1
I've been looking for quality &amp,0
This time I turned to Amazon &amp,0
was so surprised,0
"I'm 6' 2"" &amp",0
205 lbs with long arms and not super fit,0
I ordered 5 shirts &amp,0
"all were delivered quickly, as promised and in perfect shape",1
I didn't see any irregularities in any shirts either,1
I will definitely buy again,1
Shirts were perfect,1
Just as described,1
Beautiful colors,1
Shipping was fast,1
Very cheap looking material/shirt,2
Extremely disappointed with the fit of this shirt,2
"for a fitted shirt it's too big, I had to pay my Tailor to adjust it",2
if I was in the USA I would have returned it,2
Highly recommend,1
Disappointed in this purchase,2
Needed a quick replacement for a white shirt so took a chance and bought this one on prime instead of my regular brand,1
"Felt and looked cheap, arms were very wide",2
Quality has gone way down compared to the shirts from the 90's,2
Spend the extra $7 and go with something like TM Lewin on sale or CT shirts,2
The shirt arrived quickly in time for a mtg and the product was as described,1
Slim fit perfects,1
"And it has pockets, unlike many other shirts out there",0
"Great fit and no wrinkles, came in one day",1
Nice quality shirt,1
Fits great,1
I Looked for this color,1
My dad had one and I always love that color,1
These are great shirts,1
I am slim and about 6 foot 3 and this shirt fits perfectly,1
The fabric resists wrinkling well and resists staining as well,1
Definitely worth twice it's price as it's hard to find a good slim fit dress shirt that holds up well to general work wear and tear,1
Decent shirt low price wrinkle-free,1
I love this item I love how it came to my house on time and the overall condition was good I wear this to work and got my co workers asking me where did I buy this item at,1
This is a great dress shirt for the money,1
I've worn these for three years at work,1
Gotta wear black shirt at work,1
"I buy four each year, and they last amazingly well",1
With the proper care I might get two years out of them,0
"Wash cold water, dry on delicate",0
Or air dry on hanger,0
Excellent product,1
Long lasting,0
They are too small,2
Size is non even close to the real one and sleeves are very short,2
Horrible purchase,2
An XL is like a Small---,2
I don't have allergies or delicate skin by ANY means and fabric softener isn't an options with polyester,2
so this may end up good money lost on a lesson learned,2
"REMOVE THE TAG, its irritable",2
After one wash it shrunk considerably as well,2
I didn't like how thin the shirt was either as you can essentially see through it if you hold it up,2
"Even though the sleeve says 36-37, it's barely even a 36",2
More frustrating is that there is no extra material in the length of the shirt,2
"If someone has long arms, they usually have a long torso to go with them",0
like me,0
I wouldn't buy another one,2
Not wrinkle free/ resistant,2
Sizing is not accurate,2
Good fit,1
Quality workmanship,1
Quality product,1
I have now ordered 10 dress shirts in different colors,0
Very satisfied,1
"I will never trudge the mall to go back to the ""men's"" store",0
Fits as expected,1
priced right,1
irons well,1
I purchased three white shirts,0
I will beyond a shadow of a doubt be purchasing again and again,1
I am very pleased with this product,1
I did not find this shirt transparent as other reviewers commented,0
I also found the stays sewn in the collar to be a pro rather than con,1
They stay in place perfectly,1
My husband fit perfect in this shirt will buy more colors,1
On time and as advertised,1
Su color,0

Good fit,1
Lightweight nice material,1
Looks crisp,2
Very pleased with the purchase and will buy from this vendor again,1
Quick delivery,1
nice fit,1
Lots of extra baggage in the arms and bag,0
If you are actually skinny this will be huge on you,0
Comfort was that of a $20 shirt,0
"Hard to get an accurate idea of the true color, and it was a bit bif",2
Nice,1
Not a good shirt,2
Black color is dull,2
Very wrinkled,2
Material is very thin not like a typical Van Heusen shirt,2
Love color,1
This shirt was gigantic on me,2
"""Fitted"" is absolutely not the case",2
I returned it and bought a shirt from Kohls that was actually a fitted style with the exact same measurements,2
Shirt fabric is very thin and is stiff rather than soft,2
Returned,2
The shoulders and biceps area are very tight when reaching forward,2
Otherwise it is a good shirt,1
"Rechecked my size to make sure, it doesn't come close to fitting",2
Just face the fact i ordered the wrong size,0
Very nice shirt,1
Very cheaply made shirt,2
Runs very small and the shirt tail is way too short,2
I had to return it because I cannot tuck it into dress pants it is so short,2
Fit good,1
My husband really likes this brand and style of,1
shirt,1
Good price fit well,1

Fits me perfectly,1
Fit exactly as expected,1
Nice summer shirt,1
Comfortable and light weight,1
"My husband absolutely loves this shirt, it fits perfectly",1
The shirt is pretty nice,1
Quality is what I expected,0
A warm iron will be needed to have a crisp look,0
"Material is decent, stitching is fine",1
I'd buy it again for $22,1
I've tried on similar shorts with same dimensions and this fits way too small,2
"Also, it isnt that comfortable",2
"Material is rough, not enough cotton content",2
This shirt is quite a bit larger at the waist and would accommodate a sizable beer belly,2
I was trying to match a Van Heusen shirt that is more tailored,0
"A nice vibrant color, that stays fresh after a wash",1
"I just booked a commercial after wearing this to the audition, so I'm gonna give it some credit for looking professional and like something a car salesman might wear",1
A decent dress shirt,1
Best deal without all the hassles of finding your size,1
Men?셲 dress shirts have to be the hardest to find especially with neck and sleeve sizes,0
Amazon beats outlet prices as well,1
Save your gas and valuable time,1

Would purchase again,1
Gene,1
Nice tailor fit,1
I always have two white and two black shirts on deck in the closet for any occasion,1

", all of them the same size",0
"The blue and purple fit perfectly, the mist was way to large for me to use",0
"Economical dress shirt, easy to iron",1
plenty of colors to choose,1
This shirt is nice even though the fabric is thin,1
any time that I lift my arms the shirt immediately becomes untucked,2
"Oh well, I'll just keep my arms down",0
My husband is tall and has an 'athletic' build,0
This fitted shirt fits him well and I was able to order longer arms than I can usually find in-store in a large,1
"I'm 5'-11"", 200lbs, with a thick neck",0
"18-1/2"" fits perfect",1
The collar fit is the most important feature,1
And the price was good,1
Very uncomfortable material and looks cheap,2
Feels like wearing a paper bag,2
Fits good,1
Great brand of clothing,1
"5, 34/35 i am accustomed to buy",1
Great fit read the instructions on sizing and shows correctly from a previous shirts I had my closet,1
Point collars are so hard to find and they are a perfect balance to my round face,1
It is a nice fitted shirt that does not make me look like I am wearing a parachute above my pants,1
I am impressed with its wrinkle resistant nature,1
I owe it to the poplin material,1
It looks cheap and see through,2
I won't buy it again,2
I was prepared that it might not be real good,0
"It ok for an open collar shirt, under a jacket",1
"Not a good shirt for a tie as the collar looks cheap, and doesn't come out well in the wash",2
Hard to find size fit perfect,2
Not perma press  though,0
Perfect,1

Good quality and fit,1
Good fit everywhere except sleeves a little too tight for hands to fit,1
I ordered 16,0
5/32-33 and it fits perfectly,1
My husband had white color of it and needed black shirt for the funeral urgently,0
So since I knew the brand I decided to go with this one,0
I am glad I did,1
The only thing I wish it was 100% cotton,0
Great quality shirt for the price,1
Fit great following the measurements,1
Just be sure to measure yourself properly and you will really be happy with the results,1
Sharp looking shirt,1
Good quality for the price fit well,1
Compared to other shirts the same size this feels about 2 sizes too small,2
The fabric is thin and feels cheaply made,2
"I wear a suit everyday for work, these shirts are great",1
"The price is definitely right, they fit perfectly",1
I love this shirt fit as expected,1
And the color is nice as well,1
"Not even close in size, especially the sleeves",2
These shirts are the best non iron shirts I've bought,1
They fit great and are reasonably priced,1
Good shirt for the price,1
It's a fine professional setting dress shirt,1
The product quality is good,1
"I should have paid attention that it was a ""slim"" fit",0
Thin material,2
Not wrinkle-free,2
Very nice dress shirt and fits as expected,1
Fit my 12 year old son perfectly and just in time for his concert,1
I selected my size and received it in about 4 days,0
It is not a bad shirt for the price,1
Didn't shrink in the wash either,1
The size of this shirt is inaccurate,2
"I wear a dress shirt 6 days a week and this shirt says it is the same size as the other ones I wear, yet it does not fit",2
It is too small,2
Buen dise챰o tela suave,1
Fits great,1
My fianc챕 always has an issue with his dress shirts because he is very slim with longer than average arms and an athletic build,0
This shirt was a perfect solution,1
Fit him like a charm and contoured to his body,1
Also the fabric was nice and comfortable for him,1
Hoping more colors become available so we can order more,0
"Fit as expected, and good material",1
This shirt fits well and looks good,1
The fit was great considering I have a 18,1
5 neck and a 39 waist,0
I went back and bought 3 more in different colors,1
Just slightly thinner material than I was expecting,2
Looks  great,1
Fits perfect,1
And being slightly thin might even be a good thing depending on utility,1
"Overall, I was pleased",1
First white shirt perfect fit,1
Perfect,1
The material was lousy and the worst,2
These shirts consistently fit no matter what color I buy,1
I went through several makers before I finally found this brand and style,0
It's the only shirt I buy now,1
Great shirt especially for the price,1
The wide range of sizes did the trick,1
The fabric is soft,1

Nice fabric and true to size,1
There was no we t in back should have bee,1
Listed as childs,0
As expected,0
I used to have a shirt in this color and just wore it out so this was the first dress shirt I've worn in French Blue in years,0
Every time I wear it I get compliments so nothing says good choice like that :,1
"It fits very well, is comfortable and irons out really nice",1
Great price as a bonus,1
I'm definitely going to come back and get more Van Heusen shirts when I'm ready to expand to other colors,1
The material felt very cheep,2
Quality product at a good price,1
Wife loves the way I look in it,1
I ordered this for work,0
I am female,0
and the only issue I have is that I should have gotten the 15 neck instead of the 15,0

like it,1
I knew the size and length and ordered this shirt,0
Fits nice,1

Should've bought a size larger,0
Great dress shirt A+,1
These are great shirts,1
"I didn't notice the ""fitted part"" when I ordered this",0
I wear them daily for work,1
Not anymore,1
This is my first time purchasing so size-specific,0
versus S/M/L,0
online ever so I was pleasantly surprised when it fit so well,1
The fabric is pretty good and it holds up well to wrinkles,1
"The fit is very good, though I would have liked it to be a little more fitted because there was slightly more billowing than I would have liked",0
"Otherwise, this is a fantastic shirt",1
This shirt came just as expected,1
Very fresh and clean,1
Nicely packaged and bright white,1
The shirt fits my husband perfectly,1

Me gusto la camisa y volver챠a a comprarla en otros colores,1
Beautiful shirt,1
Nice shirt,1
Great color,1
Would buy again,1
Ordered multiple shirts,1
"Same brand, version, size, just different colors",0
"This shirt arrived without any new tags, had tuck-in creases along the bottom, and ring around the collar",0
Sorting returns and selling as brand new needs a little more accuracy applied in the process,2
Was skeptical due to some of the reviews on poor sizing,0
"5ft 10, 160 lbs",0
Bought 15,0
5 34/35,0

Lasts long considering weekly washings,1
Perfect fit,1
"It's ""fitted"" so it tapers down toward the waste",0
Not a normal cut shirt,0
This is the way fitted hurts are supposed to fit,2
Not skin tight,0
It is noticeable so get it only if that's what you want,0
Nice quality,1
Bought the green shirt for a company Christmas party,0
Washed &amp,0

My husband got compliments on the color green and how nice the color looked on him,1

Good value,1
Beautiful fabric with the perfect tapered fit,1
Nice long tail,1
Exquisite stitching,1
I bought 2 more colors,1

Exactly how is described and advertised good quality good product for half the price,1
Great shirt,1
Very happy with this shirt,1
Good fit,1

This shirt somehow feels a little cheaper and there are a ton of loose threads on it,2
The color is great,1
It fits as expected,1
It appears to be of good quality,1
The fit is good,1
Excellent and I like how it fits me,1
My issue is that the shirt is practically see through,2
I feel that this shirt is a knock off,1
I have bought this same shirt before and wanted a second,1
I saw the deal and got excited,1
Always afraid of buying clothes online,0
Plus it's a name brand so size was as described,1
I measured him and sent off for this shirt,0
When it arrived he tired it on and it fit perfectly,1
He said it won't be so bad to wear this shirt,1
High praises I tell ya,1
Got this as a gift for my dad and he loved it,1
When they say ?쐄itted??they apparently mean fitted for someone who weighs 200+ pounds,2
My husband love these dress shirts,1
Ok,1
The color was perfect,1
The fit was fantastic,1
Sleeves had too much room,2
Was also very roomy by the waist,2
"Returned, too shiny",2
Great shirt for a lower price than any of the stores I purchased from,1
Will buy again,1
"Buena tela, qued처 perfecta",1
Love the color,1
It is almost impossible to find fitted shirts with an 18 1/2 neck,0
They usually stop at 18,0
I ordered two shirts and they could not have fit better,1
I liked them so much that I ordered two more which should be arriving any day,1
Very happy,1
Great shirt,1
is wrinkle resistant,1
"Fit well, and looked good enough to wear to a charity fundraiser event :",1
"Great quality, good value",1
These shirts should be purchased at least a size larger than you would normally buy,0
This shirt was purchased as a Christmas Present,0
Good price good fit,1
"I am very pleased with my purchase of a well fitted dress shirt that is wrinkle-free, with unbelievable comfort",1
"These shirts have really great value, and you will not be disappointed in its quality and fit",1
Looks great,1
"Decent thread count, true fit to provided size chart, endures weekly dry cleaning, no shrinkage",1
These are my go to dress shirts for work,1
Small,2
Great shirt,1
wore it to work and loved the way it fits and feels,1
Unfortunately I messed up the collar with meds I have to use on my face so I will end up having to order another one,0
Seems like a thin shirt for the price,2
"Somewhat small, will be returning and purchasing a different brand",2
Great shirt,1
Bought it because it has the athletic fit,0
Was part of my gifts to my son for christmas,0
Love the fact that it is 70% polyester and 30% cotton,1
which makes it a no wrinkles wash and dry dream,1
"Nice color, fits perfectly on me",1
wrinkle free after wash,1
I have size 42 shoulders and size 30 waist,0
The shoulder seams of this shirt fit right on,1
"Is there such a thing as ""super athletic fit,"" even for those of us who are not super athletes?",0
"perfect fit, on time delivery, tnx",1
Stays sharp even after repeated washing,1
Arrived on time and fits great,1
Love being able to find a shirt that fits correctly,1
Thick stiff fabric,2
I've been wearing these Van Heusen shirts for many years,1
They look good and hold up well,1
I think they look fine without ironing if you put them on a hanger as soon as the dryer stops,1
Affordably priced too,1
As advertised,1
I ordered this for my husband to wear to our baby shower,0
The color was perfect and it looks like a very expensive shirt when it wasn?셳,1
"Nice fitting , basic black shirt",1
Does require some ironing,0
"After washing the shirts they are a bit snug in the shoulders and they are not wrinkle free, the darker the color the more wrinkles are seen",2
My husband likes the athletic fit,1
I did notice after washing it twice that there are still some wrinkles even when taken right out of the dryer,2
Great shirt,1
Love,1
An ironically colored salmon pink that is generally unwearable,0
"The last time I bought 5x shirts at the Men's Warehouse  for about the same price, and already the material is better, can get away with iron free",0
"Hopefully it will last me as long as my last Van Heusen shirt, that one outlasted all 5 of the shirts I got from the Men's Warehouse",0
"I plan on getting a few more pretty soon, just wanted to make sure the fit was proper before I ordered all of them",1
I payed 19,0
"99 for each shirt, you really can't beat that price anywhere, great deal",1
This was a nice shirt good quality and nice color,1
These shirts  are beautiful,1
"light, wash up beautiful , touch up with iron &amp",1
ready to go,1
Fit perfect,1
This was a gift and he loved it,1
I am tall and slender,0
The fabric is wonderful,1
Looks great,1
Way too small at the arms,2
I ordered one size it was to small on the arms,2
So i returned and ordered longer size,0
Still too short,2
When i measured they were short from what they said,2
It is hard for me to find shirts for my husband with his measurements,0
"Size wise it is great, I wish quality was just a little better",0
Fabric is a little thin and I can tell it will wrinkle easily,2
"Great shirts, great price, nice colors",1
Very professional looking,1
Perfect for work,1
This shirt runs small,2
"I went to men's warehouse and got my measurements, and promptly went to amazon with these measurements to get a shirt for my friend's wedding",0
After shopping around a bit i landed on this shirt and ordered the sizes which i was measured for earlier that day,0
"This shirt is made for short people i guess? I am 6'4"" 200 lbs and the sleves were a good 4-5 inches short and not the length that they claim",2
Other than that shirt quality is good,1
Only one big problem with these shirt that collar is no good I will stay with the product to give away don't like it,2
I tried on one of two shirts and it did not fit in the chest,2
By the time I realized it the return window had closed,0

Everyone needs one or two white dress shirts in the wardrobe,1
The shirt does have a shine with light overhead,0
poplin weave,0
Great for dinner or formal events,1
Perhaps a more plain one would be better for strictly business or funerals,0
if you wear white to a funeral,0
My bf bought it for a wedding,0
Matched my forest green dress perfectly,1
"True to size, comfortable fit",1
Tailored fit is good,1

"Perfect fit , perfect length",1
The fabric is sturdy and breathable,1
Exactly what I expect from a good poplin,1
"On the same note, the fabric is single ply and slightly transparent",0
I can't expect more from a shirt at this price,0

He is about 5'3 and I ordered the adult small,0
It was a great fit,1
I'm happy with the purchase,1
"Really nice quality shirts, I wear them weekly",1
I also appreciate that I don't have to iron them very often,1
Very happy,1
"Shirt fit perfectly, won't need to have it altered",1
It's definitely not 'fitted' by any means,2
It hangs off me like I'm wearing a night gown,2
And I'm not a super skinny dude or anything,0
The quality of the fabric is definitely lacking and this company CLEARLY knows it because they use actual pins to fold it,2
"So when you receive the shirt, you're going to be left with about pin-tufts in it right out of the box, where the fabric was torn by the pin that you removed",2
"the shoulders, the collar, the middle of the sleeves",2
it's noticeable,2
I wouldn't pay anything for this shirt,2
Spend more on a better shirt if you have to,2
I mistakenly ordered a 15 inch neck instead of a 15,0
I will be buying more for sure,1
Just in the right size,1
It's a nice looking shirt,1

Having to return,2
Ill fitting and scratchy material,2
Much smaller than the size says,2
"If you?셱e a taller and sturdier guy like I am, definitely order bigger in this brand than you normally would",0
I felt like I was going to rip out of the shirt,2
I have ordered many of these shirts,1
they always fit well,1
Consider a slim fit if you're an ectomorph like me,0
"16"" 32-33 sleeve",0
Nice quality for the price,1
Great Fit,1
Nice,1
Needed a tall shirt,0
Not long enough,2
"Horrible fit, not at all fitted",2
The shirt fits like how I would expect my grandfathers dress shirts from the 80s to fit,2
See photo,0
I?셫 6????so a bought a tall size,0
Sleeves and neck fit,1
Shirt is too short,2
"They didn't make it clear, or I missed it, that these have sewn in plastic collar stays",2
I prefer pocket into which I can put metal stays and remove for washing/pressing,0
Great fit and clean seams,1
Decent quality for the price,1
"Very high quality shirt, well packaged,  including 6 pins holding it to  the card stock display piece",1
Workmanship seems excellent,1
And that's not a bad thing,1
Fitted design keeps shirt from feeling blouse-like,1
"The shirt fits well, strikes an appropriate balance of style and durability, and is adequately wrinkle-free when warm out of the drier",1
These properties make this shirt is the workhorse of my daily work wardrobe,1
Needed a new dress shirt for an important meeting in a couple days,0
Paid for over night and it arrived on time,1
The shirt fit exactly as I needed,1
Looks good fabric is a little thin,0
Fits perfect for fitted cut,1
I loved the fit and color,1

Bought is for my grandson away at Ministry so he could wear it for church,0
So disappointed in Van Heusen,2
Won?셳 buy their products again,2
GOOD QUALITY MATERIAL,1
WELL DONE,1
NEEDS IRONING,0
GAD,0
Measurements were spot on,1
Very nice shirt fits perfectly,1
Love the color,1
"Excellent product for its price, I have seen this  shirt is made in different countries with different cut patterns from same size making them differ one from the other",1
Great,1
Great color and fit,1
Great shirt,1
For well,1
I got the fitted shirt and that's too huge,2
Nothing fitted about it,2
As expected,1
So glad amazon carries my brand of shirts,1
Fit is always perfect,1
vanHeusen is the only shirt that carries my size,1
These are nice shirts for the price,1
My son is 6'4' and the 151/2 34 sleeve fit him well,1
The slim fit was a really nice fit,1
They wash and dry clean well and for the price I got 4 of them to interchange,1
It feels so much like plastic,2
like the same fabric they use for a raincoat,2
it's really unpleasant,2
The shirt fits great,1
Has kept its color after many washes,1
Still feels new,1
Good shirt,1
"Sleeves too short and neck too tight, very disappointed",2
Comfortable,1
"I love the fact,  I didn't have to shop and it could be delivered the next day also machine washed it and hang dry for an easy iron",1
Great product love the shirts and colors,1
Product as described,0
"I have this shirt in black, and always liked it",1
"I needed white as well and was down a size, so I thought I'd get this for under $25",0
The fit is fine,1
"I like that you can order by neck/shoulder, as opposed to generic S/M/L",1
The material is TERRIBLE,2
"First, it just feels cheap on the skin",2
"Like the cheapest, plasticy poly-cotton blend ever",2
"Second, it's transparent",2
You can count my arm hairs through this shirt,2
You can see the *seams* on my undershirt,2
"This shirt made my arms look red, through the cloth, even when the shirt wasn't touching my skin",2
there are so many colors to chose from and one who loves to look good at work this helps me stay on top of it,1
Good quality nice shirt,1
For a fitted shirt this was really loose on my son,1
The material was nice and we have bought this brand before,1
"My son had to wear it because it was to close to return it, luckily he wore a jacket over where the slit was",0
All is good,1
Just as spected,1
The texture and feel of the shirt cloth material is the best ever for me,1
"Overall fit was excellent, although the neck was slightly too tight by 1/8 inch",0
Everything else was perfect and one of the best valued purchases I've experienced,1
Items were packaged professionally and shipping was quick,1
Absolutely no complaints,1
Ordered my size and it fit well out of the box,1
Overall a very good shirt for the price,1
To small even though they were out of the big and tall The fitted made them too tight,2
"Fits and looks great , not loose",1
These are so nice,1
"They come in extra long sleeves, if needed",0
They don't come have optional cuff link openings,0
Fits well,1
Very similar to previous Van Heusen's products that I have bought in the past from actual stores,2
Material is rough and not nearly the high quality that their athletic fit shirts,2
It's a little tight in the chest,2
This shirt is absolutely awful,2
The sleeves appear to be stained due to the color bleeding out and it wrinckles worse than any shirt that I've ever had before,2
"Fits me perfectly, good quality shirt, good price",1
This is the only brand and size of shirt I have found that fits my husband well,1
"This looks so nice on him: the pockets are not too low, and the armpits are right where they should be",1
Fabulous,1
Thank you,1
Very very nice husband were please,1
A good shirt,1
Fits well,1
Has held up being warn every three days and washed the same,1
Used in a retail environment and is comfortable for eight hour shifts,1
Perfect,1
Was not a fitted fit,0
"The buy in emergency, I needed to wear a black shirt and picked out for money and not for the brand",0
I found it excellent in every way and I like the texture of the fabric is very soft and fresh and feels great,1
"Next time I will buy this brand, which I have found it very satisfactory",1
"This brands needs to make their shirts a tad longer, I have a long torso",2
Nice shirts,1
Great fit and fabric,1
I will buy more,1
Usually I like Van Heusen as inexpensive and wearable at the same time,0
"I also feel like it is packaged better - made in Egypt the label says, I don't know if that is the reason",1
Product was listed under prime selections,0
Almost bought this in the size I needed 18,0
95 shipping charge,0
"I looked more carefully and saw then message that 'Prime"" was available only in some sizes and some colors",0
"I bought size 18 before without shipping charges, and now I went to look and was glad to see 18",0
5 neck available,0
If it is because it is an unusual size and ships from a different location location or different company I want to know that right upfront,2
It  is easy to fall into the 1-click mode without paying attention to small details and the process shouldn't be tricky to seek higher fees,2
This shirt solved a serious problem for me,1
"I was pleased to find a shirt with an 18"" neck with 32-33"" sleeve",1
This is not a size you commonly find in stores,0
The fact the shirt is fitted means I did not have an excess of material I had to hide under a suit coat,0
I am so satisfied with my purchase I just bought the same shirt in white,1
Beautiful color,1
Fits perfectly,1
Launders great,1
Wrinkle free,1
Van heusen wrinkle-free shirts are the staple of my work wardrobe- a note of caution- they need to be washed/ruined in a cycle with plenty of water or they can develop brown marks that look like burns,1
I love this shirt,1
"It fits great for a 5""10 160 lb, 41"" chest, 34"" inch waist male",1
Pricing make the shirt an excellent value,1
affordable,1
Product fit like it's supposed to and at a good price,1
Looks great,1
Well tailored and wrinkle resistant,1

This review is for Van Heusen Poplin Fitted Long Sleeves shirt with 15,0
"5"" neck and 34-35"" sleeves",0
"This size has 18"" shoulder width and 37"" waist size",0
First and foremost in buying clothes is the fit/cutting,0
Overall fit is good,1
The neck and sleeve sizes are as expected,1
"I'm 5'9"", 175 lbs",0
"My chest is 42"" and this shirt fits very well",1
It might be too tight if I have a slightly thicker chest,0
"Arms should have enough room for up to 16-17"" arm",0
"Mind you this is a ""Fitted"" shirt, so the shape is slimmer in the mid section and larger in chest",0
"I never bought any Fitted shirt before, so it was a gamble",0
I was glad it turned out to be a good bet,1
Secondly is the material,0
The fabric is decent and feels a bit rough to the skin,1
The wrinkle-free fabric is mixed of 65% polyester and 35% cotton,0
I've worn it for the whole day and it didn't get wrinkled easily,1
"It comes with a ""Oeko-Tex"" tag that says tested for and free of harmful chemicals",0
The workmanship is mediocre and lack of accuracy in the details,2
I bought 2 colors of the same shirt and one of them feels tighter than the other,2
Summary: I like it and bought 3 more,1
Would be better if it comes with removable collar stays/inserts and more color options,2
Good quality,1
Good color,1
Not true that is transparent,1
For me is ok,1
Awesome shirt,1
Lotsa compliments and looks and feels great,1
Wrinkle free,1
Good price,1
"a lil baggy in the arms, which is a huge pet peeve",2
this is good brad of shirt to were to church or a wedding  or if you are office person,1
"shirt tail is too short, doesn't stay tucked in",2
"It's bigger than expected, for me at least, and it seemed the fabric would easily get undone since it had too many of those strings sticking out",2
It seems to fit like a normal shirt and not quiet so fitted,2
I got what I ordered,1
Perfect,1
My hubby looks amazing in it,1
He?셲 a big boy too,0
240Ibs and 6??,0
Just what I needed,1
I was actually little hesitant to buy clothing through Amazon this is my first shot at it unless you count the sandals I bought last summer which worked out perfectly any rate this delivered exactly as advertised and I'm very happy with the product fits perfectly,1
Fits alright,1
"Overall, a nice buy and serves well for the day-to-day desk job environment",1

It was shipped out quickly inside of a secure package,0
My husband loves it,1
I love how he looks wearing it,1
It compliments broad shoulders and physique,0
Ordered 17,0
5 - 36-37 so that it would be extremely large on me,0
I generally wear 16,0
"5, 34-35 - Fit more like a 16, 34-35",2
Bought this shirt for an event that required me moving around a lot,0
Didn't even wear it at all,2
Shirt fits perfectly,1
nice construction as usual with VH,1
no more cheap shirts for me,2
"Don't buy this shirt if you are over 5'8""",2
The length of this shirt is about 3-4 inches less than a same size dress shirt from a quality shirt manufacturer,2
Even with a size 37 sleeve three bloody of the shirt is short,2
Also the fabric feels like paper,2
I recommend steering clear,0
Excellent overall,1
Nice,1
good fit,1
"Keep in mind this shirt is VERY thin, I wear it with a white hanes undershirt so that people cant see my nipples",2
no joke,0
"The collar fits a bit tighter than expected, give yourself an extra 1/2""",2
"Otherwise its been great, very happy with it",1
This shirt fits and looks great,1
It is exactly what I wanted,1

"I have since started just biting the bullet and buying higher end dress shirts, I still wear this one occasionally though",0
good shirt,1
Love the fit,1
I have a big chest/back and the sleeves are a bit too short for me,2
It was perfect,1
nice quality shirt for work or the theatre,1
I have an odd size to fit as I have grown older,0
The shirt size of: 18 1/2 by 32 fitted me well,1
I have not yet sent this to the local cleaners for wash and medium starch,0
Will let you know the outcome,0
Hopping it will not shrink,1
Great shirts at a great price,1
Looks great,1
Perfect fit and color,1

Great material and it?셲 perfect,1
Perfect fit and high quality product,1
"Apparently this is their more athletic fit, which I like",1
"It fits perfect, as expected, nice feel for a summer shirt",1
Works with my leap day bowtie and doesn't wrinkle up too easy,1
Great shirt,1
Fit perfectly,1
Durable and washes great,1
It was a sure order for a family vacation photo and didn?셳 know until it was too late and had to cut a slit in the back of the shirt just to get it to fit right,2
I was very disappointed with the quality of this product,2
"Wow, size was way off",2
I ordered a 18 36-37 shirt,0
I own other brand shirts this same size,0
and no way were those sleeves were 36-37,2
"Sleeves were too short, shoulders too tight",2
Very dissapointed,2
The first is the top,0
collar,0
"The collar is a little shorter than I'm use to, because it doesn't fully cover my necktie around the back of my neck",2
"otherwise, great shirt",1
Nice quality shirt for the money,1
Also hard to find size available,0
"Even though the shirt is described as fitted, it certainly isn't fitted",2
It's a weird fit,2
My husband doesn't like it,2
Perfect,1
This shirt made me actually measure,0
"neck, chest, arms",0
I usually have a problem with sleeve length,0
I have to get a shirt that is to big to accommodate gangly arms,0
Muy buen color,1
"Good fit, great colors",1
Bought more of different colors,1
Would not recommend this shirt,2
"It is cut too short, fit is terrible",2
"Do yourself a favor and select another brand, you will be very disappointed with this shirt",2
Shirt was nice,1
As expected,1
Still waiting for my refund,0
"Nice shirt good quality, will buy again",1
Very nice shirt,1
Sleeve length is wicked off really upset because I measured my husband before purchasing,2
Now apparently I can?셳 return it,0
This shirt in white is completely see through,2
Beautiful fitted shirt with perfect length sleeves,1
Long,2
"Received mis-labeled shirt, no way is it a 34"" sleeve",2
"Not worth returning at 20 bucks, taking it to goodwill",2
"Lesson learned, won't be ordering dress shirts from here",2
I bought 3 of these shirts to use as work shirts,1
I am athletic so I knew I would have to get them tailored,0
The shirts were to my standards in every way,1
Excellent value for standard shirts,1
Love this shirt,1
Great material and fit,1

The pocket was deep enough to hold his passport,1
Good looking and inexpensive,1
Great buy,1
Quite fitted,1
We returned,2
Well made,1
Fit perfectly,1
My husband has a large neck and short sleeve length,0
I ordered the fitted shirt and it looked great,1
Short sleeve lengths are hard to find in the stores,0
I tried a several stores before I ordered from Amazon,0
Thank you Amazon,1
Van Heusen is an amazing bulk clothes manufacturer,1
The fit and color are spot on,1
Very sturdy constructed shirt,1
Have had it over a year now and it still fits great and the color is still just as bright,1
"Nice and soft, good fit-no issues at all",1

Cuffs a smidge large,0
Overall a very good shirt,1
I usually wear 15,0
I only bought the 16 in this shirt because they did not have the 15,0
5 in 36/37 sleeve length,0
The 16 is way too big for me,0
"I am 5'9"" tall and weigh 171Lbs",0
"Fit my very tall, very skinny 13yo son great",1
Needed it for his jazz band concerts,0
No complaints,1
Excellent quality shirt,1
The tailored fit helps keep it tucked in,1
This shirt is rather baggy and the sleeve measurements are off,2
The shoulders taper to the collar,2
instead of running flat,2
resulting in a triangular look from shoulder to neck,2
Quality shirt,1
Work shirt washes nicely,1
It was a perfect fit and quality was excellent,1
Loved it,1
Seems like a well- fitting good quality shirt,1
"These shirts are a nice accomodation for my need for an 18 neck, without the body of the shirt fitting like a sail",1
"Still a good purchase, given the price",1
I like the brand and did not go wrong buying one on here,1
Good quality,1
Good,1
I needed a shirt for my son's school picture day,0
He's tall and thin so this fit was slim so it didn't look like he was swimming in a clown shirt,1
The color is a nice deep blue and combined with a stylish tie made for a great school photo,1
Shirt fits as expected and wears well,1
Would I buy it again,1
yes I will,1
This shirt is way too short,2
I have never bought a brand that won?셳 tuck into my suit pants,2
Color and fabric,0
"Didn't realize it was ""fitted"" when I ordered it",0
"I usually wear ""regular"" for the comfort of more room",0
I do like the shirt and workmanship,1
Because it is fitted I can order a big neck size shirt as needed without the body being too large for my body and arms,1
Great shirt though,1
Solid quality fabric and great dark blue color,1
Great shirt,1
Casual dress shirt no tie,0
excellent,1
"I've been looking for a shirt to fit my neck and at the same time not to make me look as a balloon, and Van Heusen just accomplished that",1
The only bad thing is that they DO NOT have more variety of colors to choose from,2
Have wore Van Heusen shirts for years and this one did not disappoint,1
El color no es el indicado,2
I was impressed with the tapering,1
It actually fit better than expected,1
I would buy again,1
This shirt is exactly what I was looking for and the wrinkle free feature is stark contrast compared to my other new shirt,1
I think I will stick with Van Heusen,1
Quite nice material and comfortable,1
Fits as expected and looks good,1
Nice material and well made,1
It fit perfectly,1
It looks great,1
Great quality,1
Great price for a quality name brand,1
Odd since I'd gotten a black Van Heusen a few years ago that this was replacing and it seems to be a totally different fabric disappointingly,2
Excellent quality and great price,1
Perfect fit,1
Thank you,1
Great shirt,1
Fits to the right size,1
Good quality,1
For a nice Formal dress suit,1
Great fit,1
"Quite nice, it's tough to find shirts big in the chest and neck, without being huge in the belly",1
"This works quite well, I'm not thin in the belly area",1
by any means,0
This product is between a regular and a slim fit,0
It feels loose really,2
Maybe order a size below your normal,0
Love it,1
Fits great,1
The best price for a quality product,1
"These are light shirts, and I play with the Circus",0
They work,1
We loved this shirt,1
My husband has only wore it about 5 times and this is what happened,2
I wish we could return it because he has hardly used it and it ripped so easily,2
I love how this shirt looks and it is a great gift,1
Fit and finish was very good,1
Quality of fabric was also very good,1
Good shirt for the money,1
"Van Heusen makes high quality clothing that looks good and feels great,",1

"Can you offer other colors, such as, light blue, red, etc",0
It is the same size I always order,0
hard to find a long sleeve red shirt and this fits the bill,1
Always quality clothing,1
I've been wearing Van Heusen dress shirts for years,0
"I have always loved the quality, fit, and maintenance of these shirts",0
This was the first time I bought one without seeing it first,0
I won't hesitate to order more,1
Disappointed at the fit of this shirt,2
I've been buying van huesen shirts for years,0
Sleeves too short despite big and tall size,2
The shirt was a perfect fit and the material was great,1
There were approximately 6 pins put in the shirt to hold it in place,2
This caused 12 tiny holes in the shirt across the shoulders and upper back area,2
Fits well,1
Returned for slim fit version,0
I?셫 6????,0
Great product and great price,1
I can never find athletic fit  shirts,0
This is great,1
"I have a feeling that this is the ""new"" regular fit",1
"This is a nice shirt, looks nice, easy to take care of and looks real good too",1
Happy with the purchase,1
Fast shipping,1
It fits well and the material is cool,1
Bought these for my husband because I was having a hard time finding his size in the stores,0
Love the shirt,1
Great quality,1
He wants me to get more,1
It feels more like a regular fit than a fitted shirt,2
This makes it look puffed out around the waist and causes it to be wrinkled,2
I'm a skinny guy so this is more of a problem,0
Maybe good for a bigger guy,0
Otherwise its a good price for a formal look,1
1st time buying this and most likely last time also,2
The length of the shirt is small compare to other ones I have,2
They get untucked fast due to its length which is very annoying to me,2
Looks good with my husbands business suits,1
Happy with the product,1
"I am 6'2"" tall and 235#",0
Regular fit shirts aren't really for someone who is of average or even a bit above average size,0
They look and feel like they are made for someone on the big side of the spectrum,0
So if you aren't quite a bit larger than me I know you would be much happier with fitted,0
It's so incredibly difficult to find my proper size,0
The obvious advantage is that this was the best way to buy the shirt,0
"I was tired of driving around looking for the proper fit, and never finding it",0
"Very easy order, and very pleased with the shirt",1
My son has purchased this shirt before and likes it so I bought him another one,1
"Good shirt and no complaints, priced right",1
He loves the fit,1
he is on the thin side,0
"I use this shirt for work, and I like it",1
"I like how comfortable the material is and I don't get hot very easily in this shirt either, like some I've used before",1
"Highly recommend this shirt, whether for casual or for work, or anything really",1
The design and the comfort make it a very versatile shirt,1
Basic work shirt,1
Perfect for office,1
not dress,0
Super comfortable,1
Great price,1
Consistent quality,1
I've worn these for more than 20 years,1
Cant go wrong with a fitted shirt,1
A real slim shirt,1
I will buy again,1
Nice fabric too and won shrink,1
Van Heusen is my favorite shirt,1
"Love this shirt, great fit and long enough to tuck in and move around with out it becoming untuck like some other dress shirts I have, use it for work with sleaves rolled up and can handle movement well",1
Very happy with product,1
Fits well will look great on our groomsmen,1
Good quality,1
Given as a birthday present,0
"Beautiful shirt, fits well and doesn't wrinkle",1
Great quality and feel,1
"Received it only now, due to shipping time",0
Unfortunately the shirt doesn?셳 meet the expectations at all,2
"The shirt is too big, it isn?셳 ?쐄itted ??as described",2
Can?셳 wear it,2
Too small,2
To call this shirt a slim fit is not at all accurate,2
I have a 44 inch chest and 32 inch waist,0
athletic build,0
I wound up with six extra inches of fabric on both sides,2
Unfortunately I bough t two of them,0
"FYI-- the ""free"" returns comes with a lot of fine print-- like, if you try the shirt on it's pretty much ineligible for return according to the rules",0
Just as I expected it to be,1
"Good quality, fits well, and good price",1
"I bought two such shirts,  black and grey, a few months ago, and really like them, so this was a repeat order",1
I'd get some other colors if they were available in my size,1
The only minor complaint is that they need to be ironed when unpacked because of some wrinkles,2
Great price and fits well with excellent reasonably well tailored materials,1
Looks great till I got lazy and washed it and I cant fit it,1
Excellent fit,1
Comfortable shirt and fits nice for someone in shape,1
Great price,1
This shirt is very good for the price,1
Great fit and the material is very light,1
perfect the the hot and humid summers,1
Perfect fit,1
The green/gray color of this shirt is lovely,1
Perfect fit,1
At least equivalent to an XXL,0
Great fit,1
Used this in my wedding and it is definitely a nice shirt for a great price,1
excellent product,1
A very reliable product that comes in a timely manner just as expected,1
Never had an issue and love how easy this is,1
"Very nice shirts, I had one for years and saw these",1
Great shirts w/tie or not,1
Wish they had more colors in my size,0
My 5th one purchased,0
Bought these looking at the discounted price on Black Friday,0
Disappointed with the quality and the fit,2
Has to be ironed no matter what the ad says,2
definitely fitted,1
This is NOT fitted,2
This is more like a regular - far too large around the tummy on my average sized husband,2
This goes back,2
Good fit,1
You can't expect nothing less than quality from Van Heusen,1
"great fit, color et",1
The length was a bit longer than expected so I would wear this shirt tucked in only,0
Nice bright white and fits perfectly,1
I use it for work,1
I probably order another one,1
I'm a chauffeur so I wear white shirts all the time,0
Very nice basic shirt,1
Fit is good for slender-normal waist line,1
Nice shirt and fits as expected,1
The quality is great for the price,1
Value,1
Nice shirts,1
Great fitted dress shirt and looks good too,1
Just a little slow on shipping and delivery even though it was a Prime item,2
This is my go to shirt for any non-tie semi-formal occasion,1
If you wear any large knot,0
"double Windsor, etc",0
half the knot will be under the collar,0
"Other than that, these shirts are fantastic at the price point",1
The shirt fitted as expected and with the usual quality of Van Heusen shirts,1
Great fit,1
I will definitely be buying this again,1
It's a very nice shirt,1
Fit absolutely perfect,1
My husband has long arms and medium build,0
Usually hard to get the perfect fit,0
"Perfect fix , nice shirt",1
"Nice cut, fits well",1
Would buy again,1
"Great Shirts, Especially for the price",1
Can I please reorder for the same economic cost?,1
"Not quality, thin, see through",2
I was looking for a very slim fit shirt and this just wasn't it,2
"Although, the quality felt fine and would serve it's purpose",1
Nice shirt,1
"feels good, looks sharp",1
My preferred front collar cut,1
"Just as fine as other brands that cost more, all good",1
Great fit,1
Great quality,1
Can compared with a $100+ dress shirt,1
This shirt is advertised as ?쏤itted??,2
The only way this could be classified as fitted is if my son was 9 months pregnant,2
Nice shirt,1
"I'm 5-10, 190 lean, and bought a Medium with 32/33 sleeves",0
Wrinkle free shirt came with hundreds of wrinkles,2
Ironic,2
"When I wear it, people can clearly see my nipples",2
"This is very embarassing, and I regret buying this shirt",2
fitted for normal body not athletic,0
"Great quality shirt, the fitted style looks wonderful on my very lanky teenage son",1
We usually have trouble finding him shirts that are long enough in the sleeve without winding up with the shirt being too wide,0
This one works perfectly,1
"I wear tapered shirts, the model on this might be asian as their sizes are much smaller than u",2
sizes,0
I would not buy another,2
Great order as I needed it for a wedding and great price for a solid quality shirt,1
Fit perfectly,1
Decent quality,1
Good,1
little bit short size as per fitting,2
Very good quality,1
Excellent quality,1
Perfect fit,1
Good buy,1
"Over the years, I've owned several Van Heusen dress shirts",0
"Van Heusen shirts look good, are durable and of high quality, and don't cost an arm and a leg",1
So a few weeks back I purchased VAN HEUSEN MEN'S FITTED POPLIN DRESS SHIRT,0
"""Fitted"" it's not",2
"I'm a big guy, with a wide chest and a waistline about 4 inches more than it should be--and this shirt, with it's 18 1/2 inch neck, should swallow me",0
or worse,2
"It's a completely uncomfortable wear, and a significant disappointment",2
"If you're a big guy, buyer beware",0
#NAME?,0
"Mikels, Esq",0
Well made,1
Fits great,1
"Love the fit, except it's too short and becomes untucked",0
Van Heusen needs to realize most people don't wear their pants up to their navel,2
It fit me perfectly,1
Looks very good,1
I will order more as needed,1
Roy,0
It was delivered fast and fits perfect,1
This shirt is good quality and the fit was appropriate for the size listed,1
Recently I had to return some pants and shirts in my size as they did not come close to fitting as expected,2
Excellent quality,1
Great fit,1
Correct neck and sleeve length,1
"The shirt is well made and the fit is just right, could not be happier with the product",1
I highly recommend it,1
Very bad finishing and dirty,2
I have several of these shirts,0
They fit well and feel good,1
I recommend,1
You have to try each shirt on,0
They all fit different,2
Bought 3 shirts all the same size and one was extremely tight in shoulders and forearms,2
For work,0
"Fits well, good price, and comfortable",1
"I ordered a size larger on neck than my previous shirts and a size shorter in the sleeve, and it fits as expected",1
"Very nice shirt, looks great with ties",1
It was also rather thin,2
"In fact, if it were fitted properly there is no way you would be able to wear it without an undershirt",2
Fit great looks good,1
this will work for our son's concert performances,1
"Great shirt, will be buying more",1
"When you have a beanpole son with very long arms, finding a shirt that fits &amp",0
that has sleeves that work with a suit is difficult,0
This shirt fit fine-although slightly roomy-it was perfect for prom,0
"I am a first time wearer of fitted white shirts,  I am pleased with the fit",1
"My waist is 38"" and the 43"" waist in the shirt feels about right for me",1
discount for two or more would be nice,1
Very fine quality and fit,1
It fit everywhere except the shoulders,2
"I'm an average build man, so it shouldn't have been anything special needed to fit",2
It was a great buy,1
"Good shirt, yet regular fit",0
Not fitted,2
Muy buen producto y precio muy accesible,1
Well fitting and accurately sized,1
Collar fit was good as well as tail length for tucking,1
I like the material--very close to no ironing needed if you get it out of the dryer quickly,1
"Although it advertises itself as fitted, I still find the shirt fits almost like a regular dress shirt",2
Can't beat the value and quality,1
I saved an hour of my time not having to visit a department store and sift through their small selection,1
Nice for a good price,1
"I missed the ""fitted"", ""trim""",0
Too small in the waist,2
Excelent product,1
I fits perfect,1
Way too big for a fitted shirt,2
I don't know who it's fitted for,2
I had to bring the sides and sleeves in a significant amount so it didn't look like a wingsuit,2
Poplin fabric is a nice summer weight fabric,1
Really nice shirt and poplin makes it even more comfortable,1
Be aware this is a fitted shirt,0
Its easy to miss in the description and although close to fitting I believe it might shrink after going thru the dryer,2
Had to return it,2
Was not a fitted shirt in my view,2
I would consider more of a regular fit,2
Shirt bunches up at the waist,2
I would need to get it trimmed in the future for a nicer fit,0
Too baggy,2
Pocket is too low,2
"Cloth too thin, can see through it",2
Sleeves too baggy,2
Fit is perfect,1
"Looks nice, color is nice",1

Great dress shirt for a great price,1
Nice not having so much bulk around the waist,1
Be careful,2
"If you buy this ""on sale"" and it doesn't fit you have to pay the higher price to exchange for a larger size",0
i have worn VH shirts forever,0
They wash and iron with ease,1
Great shirt ??great price ??great Fit,2
"way, way too tight and small",2
"Van Heusen shirts have proven top quality and long lasting, year after year",1
Van Heusen is a brand I trust,1
This is a very nice shirt at a good value,1
I found that the fit around the belly was quite a lot slimmer than other shirts I've purchased recently and it borders on being too snug for me to wear,2
"Although I ordered the correct size for my measurements, the sleeves are too short and the rest is too loose",2
It?셲 a strange fit,2
I only took a star off because as most reviewers note it is very very thin so you can see through it if you are wearing it without an undershirt,2
otherwise it is a great buy,1
"I got this as a work shirt for my husband, he struggles with finding shirts that fit his neck",0
"This shirt fit great, and is comfortable",1
I bought the shirt for my husband to wear at my sisters wedding,0
"It is true to size, the only thing is that is not wrinkle free",0
Fit perfectly,1
Very nice shirt,1
Fits perfect and feels good too,1
Price was right,1
"I wear relatively narrow ties, and they still seem to show beneath the collar in the back no matter what I do",2
Every 10 minutes I'm trying to pull the back of the collar down to cover my tie,2
Neck is big for 15 1/2,2
"Love Van Heusen shirts, and this one did not disappoint",1
Great fit and look,1
"The collar is just slightly pronounced more than it should, it could lay down better",0
"Even though the material quality is great, it does not fit as expected",2
It is a little bulky from the sides and it is nothing compared to the pictures shown for the product,2
"Hopefully, this helps",0
Too small is an understatement,1
It was a joke and not a funny one,1
"These shirts are great, the fit was perfect",1
This shirt was for my adult son with Down syndrome,0
It fit him perfectly,1
It is so hard to find shirts in his size,0

Not worth my money,2
"If you have worn Express shirts, you would not think that these shirts are fitted in any way",2
The torso fits fine,1
Nice shirt for the money,1
I have to press it after laundering though,2
"Overall, very satisfied",1
Hubby owns several of these shirts and they wash and wear very well,1

These shirt are my new go-to,1
Fit very well and hold up like champs,1

Nice Item perfect fit,1
Great Item for the price,1
Very comfortable,1
Thank you,1
Love the ease of ordering without spending all day in the Mall stores trying to find the right size and color,1
thought it would be longer for a man with these measurements,0
This is a very nice shirt,1
good quality,1
This was a great shirt for our ten groomsmen,1
"The quality was good, especially for the price",1
"We ordered all their wedding attire off of amazon, and because of the rates we got online, it was cheaper than renting a tux",0
The guys all seemed to like the shirt,1
fits me perfect I'm 6'0 and very slim and the  14,1
"5"" Neck 32""-33"" Sleeve  fits like a glove",1
Bought 3 more,1
The shirt fits as expected and doesn't rise over the course of a day,1
Great product- excellent price fast free delivery,1
excellent t-shirt,1
Shirts arrived on time and the fit was good,1
Very pleased with the quality and the fit of this shirt,1
Just right,1
"They were much better than I had hoped for , look very nice , because I wear shirts often the collar get a ring around it after 6 or 7 wears",1
Now in the future I will  just buy a new shirt at a reasonable price,1
Perfect fit,1
Could never find in stores,0
"Fits as expected, and seems to be well made",1
Product came in a timely manner and fit exactly as needed,1
Van heusen makes some great dress shirts for an amazing deal,1
"I have a collection of their fitted dress shirts in such colors as lavendar and olive, and I always get compliments on the color/fit",1
"I got this as a 16x37, which is an odd size",2
It fits really well,1
That's the major plus,1
"The fabric isn't particularly interesting, which is neither good nor bad",0
It is really an ordinary shirt in a hard-to-find size,0
$30 is ok,0
"Best dress shirts for the money, I use dress shirts everyday, Van Heusen is the best brand for the money when it comes to dress shirts, plus they have a multitude of collar styles and sizes",1
Used as a shirt for a costume and kept it as it fit so well and was a nice quality shirt,1
Would definitely buy again,1
"Most I like, color",1
"Least, fits too large, and the material feels something rough, though I think should feel softer after washing",2
"good product, little bit expensive than other web pages and sellers, you should reduce the price of it and I will buy 2 or 3 instead just 1",2
great,1
Fit perfect,1
Nice work shirt for my son,1
Only thing I don't like about them is that the shirtstays are sewn inside the collars,2
There's no way to replace them if they get bent unless you are able to resew the collar,2
it fits very well in my frame,1
5'10 170lb,0
Van heusen fitted works great for the tapered look,1
Extremely poor quality,2
"I wore them only 2 times, dry cleaned and they have tertible sweat stains under the arms",2
They have to be tossed because they can no longer be worn to meetings,2
I own many dress shirts and never had this problem,2
Costly and disappointing,2

"A lot of that may have to do with the fact that I am 6""3 though",0
"It was very tight, might have been miss sized",2
I?셶e  bought the same shirt in a different color and it fit fine,1
"I love the collar on this, it is so straight and sharp it looks so classy, formal and neat",1
:D it fits well,1
Fit perfect,1
"Great shirt and great value,",1
small,2

"Otherwise, these are great shirts",1
"Seriously fast shipping, great experience",1
Very much appreciated,1
Buy with confidence,1
I love it,1
Fits perfectly and looks and feels amazing,1
Purchased this as a birthday gift for my son who is tall and has long arms,0
He has a terrible problem finding long sleeve shirts that fit properly,0
He said this was one of the best yet,1
Fits my husband perfectly,1
Even the arm length is long enough,1
I will buy more,1
Bought the shirt in white,0
"Very cheap, almost sheer material",1
Poofy sleeves around forearm,0
very short,2
I am very disappointed with this shirt,2
Great dress shirt,1
Perfect fit for my athletic frame,1
"wide shoulders, narrow waist",1
Not too loose or too tight,1
Perfect for that tailor made professional fitted appearance,1
Excellent buy,1
"Disappointed that there were so little options, would definitely want to buy other colors of this brand and style",2
Nice quality for the price with sharp collars and nice material,1
uncomfortable,2
I will buy again after I see how they hold up after a few cleanings,1
Great for a tall thin man,1
looks great,1
"Good shirt, very good price, good quality for the price, fit perfect",1
Great fabric,1
Reasonable price,1
good,1
i bought this shirt for my husband to replace one he already had,0
If you are looking for a shirt for a slim tall guy then this is it,1
If you have a little bit bigger guy in the middle i suggest buying the one that says REGULAR fit,0
Dress shirt,1
"Great shirt - 65% polyester, 35% cotton",1
Great fitting,1
Fitted style,1
Durable and easy-to-iron,1
Goes well with khaki pants at work,1
Great shirt,1
Fit nicely,1
"Sleeves are short, returned for a longer sleeve",2
This shirt was a pleasant surprise as it fit well and looks nice,1
For the price you can`t beat it and I intend to get more in different colors,1
Nice shirt,1
Muy buena calidad,1
Great fit,1
"The color is a faded black, the fit is definitely classic fit and not slim fitted",2
The collar stays are sewn into the shirt which always makes for nastiness after washing the shirt,2
"All in all, I do not recommend",2
Not impressed,2
Love these shirts,1
Used them for years,1
"good quality, quick shipping",1
Fitted shirt with great color and stitching,1
Perfectly ok at this price point,1
Lets be clear this is an inexpensive or perhaps cheap shirt at a low price,0
"material is too rough on skin ,sides are too short",2
"Great price, decent fit, very nice collar",1
Great shirts,1
They fit so perfect and  felt so comfortable,1
I can only imagine after a fee washes how much softer and  even better fitting they will be,1
Definitely going to be purchasing more of these for myself in the future,1
Stitching on the pocket seems to be an issue,2
Multiple shirts have came unstitched,2
Very nice shirt,1
Excellent fit and warm,1
"Good shirt, decent price",1
"i was very pleased with Van Heusen , the color was good and it feels good",1
Good quality for the price,1
Excellent quality,1
Nice shirt for the price,1
The shirt was all balled up in the package that had already been opened,2
It looked like someone had tried it on and just stuffed it back in the package,2
Fits comfortably,1
This is my husband's favorite white dress shirt for years,1
He likes fitted shirts because regular shirts are too blousy,1
"Amazon has the best price, beats the department stores by far",1
This shirt is so so,0
Very wide sleeves for muscled arms and the torso is relaxed,1
"Fue un regalo para mi papa, y le encanto",1
Color was perfect,1
Fast delivery,1
Will be perfect if it wears well,1
I wear it all the time,1
Not a bad shirt,1
"In retrospect I should have exchanged it as, for a fitted shirt, the body is a little big, as is the neck, compared to like shirts in my closet",0
Did not fit as expected,2
Was small compared to other same sized Van Huesen shirts,2
Quite tight around the neck,2
Nice shirt,1
It?셲 okay kinda tight on the sides and under arm can?셳 really stretch with it on,2
good quality,1
doesn't need ironing,1
Nice Shirt - Great Value,1
Basically it looks baggy as a result,2
A fitted shirt should not do this,2
H&amp,0
M makes a fine fitted shirt and I was hopping Van Heusen would be comparable,0
Not so in my experience,2
Great shirt,1
fits well,1
Love it,1
Good fits on my self,1
Its like a slim fit,1
I went off the size of a shirt that fit me perfect  a J,1
"Ferrar, purchased  at JC Penneys",0
Also a slim fit,0
The sleeves were too long o the Van Heusen,2
"Comparing the two side by side, the sleeves are the about the same it's the shoulders that are almost 1/2"" wider on both sides so the shirt was bulging from my vest and hanging too long on my hands",0
If you are broad shouldered then this shirt may work well for you,0
These white fitted Van Heusen dress shirts are my favorites,1
I initially bought two and then I ordered three more,1
They cost about $20 each and I ordered the 17,0
5 inch collar at 34/35 sleeve length fitted shirt,0
"I weigh about 190 lbs, about 5'10 in height and fit",0
"5"" for the fitted shirts and they fit and look great",1
Perfect shirt for a wedding,1
Looked and fit great,1
Was so relieved that the fit was PERFECT,1
Shirt is extremely thin,2
They are not kidding with they are talking about the trim cut,0
Go for it if you are really tall and lanky,0
"Great for the price, ok shirt overall",1
I bought it for waiting tables in college and this was as good as it gets at that price,1
My last one took two years of wearing it four times a week to finally starting coming apart,1
Good shirt for what you pay,1
What came was a slim fit shirt - I thought they sent the wrong thing,2
Nope the description is wrong,2
Too bad - it looks like a nice shirt and Van Heusen is my husband's favorite brand,2
"I bought the 16"" neck and 32-33"" sleeves",0
I have a thick neck and am on the skinnier side,0
31 waist I think,0
Would buy in a different size next time,0
I had to exchange to a shorter sleeves once,0
"Otherwise, it is great",1
I really enjoyed the look and feel of this shirt,1
What else can you say about a shirt? I was measured at a Sears or Macys when getting another shirt and the measurements worked when ordering this,1
Nice shirts,1
Truly a non wrinkling shirt,1
Material somewhat hard to the feel,2
Would benefit  from higher cotton content,2
not to bad for the price,1
"I liked the color, the fit and the dependability with which it arrived",1
I used the shirt to wear on-stage,0
Asian XL = USA extra small,0
Best fit I've found,1
It should have been 34-35 and I received a 36-37 which is to big on the arms and a little to loose,0
The shirt was perfect in every way,1
Delivery was on time as scheduled,1
The fitted dimensions were just right,1
The shirt is comfortable and fits,1
Very nice looking and perfect fitting shirt,1
Always liked the van heusen shirts,1
"Great looking, good fit and stylish shirt that will compliment both dress and casual settings",1
"Price, selection, quality and comfort were all considerations when purchasing this shirt",1
It has been difficult for me to find this cut and size in local stores,0
The shirt was an excellent fit as well as good quality for the price,1
Will most likely buy more,1

"EXCELLENT PRODUCT AND SERVICE, RECOMMENDED",1
The sleeve length is longer than 36,2
"I actually need a 36, so this is a tad long for me - better than too short",2
The waist and chest size are great,1
I am a 42 chest and 32 waist,0
The shirt is a little on the short side,2
"If you really need a long body, you might be disappointed",2
The fabric works well without ironing,1

"I'm having a hard time figuring how to contact the provider for this product, i wanted to exchange the sizes for the 17",2
5 34 because i found that for some reason a 32 was shorter than expected even though i own multiple shirts that are a 32 from Van Heusen,1
Van Heusen needs to get with the program and make their collar stays removable,2
very comfortable shirt,1
Not skinny fit style,2
Sleeves are huge,2
Fit much larger than same sizing in other brands,2
It's extremely thin so no tank top style undershirts unless you want everyone to know you're wearing one,2
Good product for the price,1
Great shirt,1
Perfect size for my neck and arms,1
Fabric not the same quality as Van Heusen fitted shirt bought at Macy's 10 years ago,1

"It fits well, looks good, and appears to be made well",1
Good shirt for a good price,1
Cut and fit is as advertised,1
This shirt is good for the weekly grind if you're allowed to wear business casual attire,1
If you want a dress shirt to wear with a suit go with better fabric,2
Very nice shirt,1
You'll have to iron it once,2
After that it's good to go,1
I ordered a 15-34/35 and seemed like a 17 to me,0
Way too bigger than espected and the cuality is as bad as the size,2
All fit well except the black dress shirt was larger than the others even though it is the same size,1

You will like the tapered waist and the extra sleeve length,1
"Perfect fit, and looks great",1
"If you don't have a ""spare tire"", I would recommend the fitted shirt because you don't have all that extra bagginess",2
Great shirt for the price,1
The shirt was what I expected and I didn't have to go to a store and be hassled by hipster doofus sales people,1
All around great experience,1

does'nt pucker up,1
This is the best fitted shirt ever,1
Nice,1
"I'm 5'9"" and definitely below average weight so that may be part of it",0

I'm a 14,0
5 neck with 38 in chest @ 5' 8 1'2'' @ 160lbs,0
The sleeves i chose 32''-33'' and this was quite large,2
I like my shirts fitted and this does not seem to be fitted at all,2
I normally buy dress shirts at Express and choose a Fitted Small which fits perfectly except for the sleeves being a bit long,1
The chest was not tapered to the chest and seemed more like a straight fit shirt,1
Material is sort of see through if you got the white color,2

"nice shirt, material was a little heavier than expected",1
"Bought this for my son , his words overall a good fit just wished the length was a little longer",1
my son loves this brand and the fact that they are wrinkle free,1
So I ordered every color,1
Size chart does not indicate the size is 2XL,2
This is very unclear and totally unacceptable,2
The shirt was too small,2
I returned it and never got refunded or a new shirt,2
Nice shirt,1

"I know my sizes so I wasn't surprised, Van Heusen is a good mid level merchant in their common fashions of which this is one",0
"That's not an insult, it's just a reality",0
"My poor dumb mediocre ass can afford a SNAZZY Shirt, with little to no effort because of their consistent quality",2

I purchased this for my 16 year old son and he loves the way it fits,1
Seems to be a good quality shirt,1
Great fit,1
The collar had a stain and the material was not of good quality,2
The Van Heusen fitted shirts are the best,1
The only problem is that there is not as many patterns and colors as the regular fit Van Heusen shirts,2
I saw the recipient of this gift try it on and he said for once the sleeves were long enough,1
He's thin so the fitted shirt was perfect for him,1
Good quality and definitely well made and cut,1
"Even though it stated that it was fitted, the product was still a bit big for me",2
both in the arm circumference and chest,2
this shirt fits well and is comfortable,1
It is wrinkle-resistant,1
I wouldn?셳 really call it wrinkle free it needs ironing for sure,2
great shirt comfortable,1
Very comfortable,1

They fit nicely and last a whole season,1
Not bad for a shirt priced in the 20 dollar range,1
Perfect fit and good quality,1
"I love these ""fitted"" shirts",1
It's the biggest taper of any dress shirt I've found,2
Definitely won't buy another,2
Very simple shirt,0

other wise good shirt for what you pay,1
Definitely better than something from Walmart,0

This was seriously the largest shirt I have ever tried on - I would have to gain 50-100 pounds for it to fit me right,2

I would pay a higher price to replace them down the road,2
Love the shirt,1
Great fit and material,1
i love the texture and the color,1
Good shirt,1
My son is tall,0
5월 8일,0
and thin,0
Long arms,0
These fit fine,0
"Apart from this, all things look good",1
Ordered for my son-in-law and he is happy with them,1
"Shirt arrived and was ""fitted"" for Santa Claus",0
Fits great,1
A bit to roomy for being fitted,2
Not consistent cut with another Van Heusen shirt with the same 16,0
5/34-35 fitted shirt I have,0
Little baggy in the arms,0
"I couldn't use a fitted, my mistake",0
Perfect fit,1
This showed up so quick and good quality,1
"good quality, fast delivery",1
Thanks,1
"Great quality, quick shipping",1
as advertised,0
Maybe he'll wear at t-shirt under it,0
This shirt is worthless,2
"It seemed to have mostly positive reviews, although some people warned about it being see-through",0
I foolishly ignored their comments,2
Don't make the same mistake: this shirt is transparent,2
You cannot wear it in any kind of formal setting without looking like a child,0
The cut is crap,0
"I don't know why it's called ""fitted",0
""" I am a pretty thick dude--230 pounds at 5'8",0
"Even so, the shirt is way, way to big and boxy for me",2
It's like a 5-year-old wearing his dad's shirt,0
"I have no idea who is wide enough to wear this shirt and consider it ""fitted",0
""" If my 50 inch chest isn't big enough to fill it out, who's buying this and thinking it's well-cut?",0
Trash,2
Avoid,2
"Should have paid more attention to the reviews I read which complained about the size -- ""fitted"" is hardly an appropriate description",2
"I am in no way slender, yet this shirt has at most maybe 15% less girth than a standard cut dress shirt",0
I chose this one after much browsing and searching,0
it seems that custom tailoring is the only way to achieve non-balooning midsections in dress shirts,0
"On the plus side, the fabric is nice and the neck and sleeve length were as advertised",1
Still disappointed,2
Work,0
The sleeves were too short,2
Poor quality,2
Highly disappointed,2
Way too small,2
had to hand it down to my adult son,0

Size and fit just as expected,1
Perfectly satisfied with this shirt,1
Fit exactly as described,1
Perfect,1
Solid shirt that looks professional at work for me,1

Fits well,1
The name says it all,0
fit is small,2

"I was impressed by the quality,fit and price of this shirt",1
I will be buying more,1
He says he's going to try to loose weight,0
I may return them,2
I didnt realize that when they say fitted it means everything is smaller--even the sleeves were 2-3 inches too short and i have worn 34 inch sleeves for 35 years,0
Fits perfect and you get what you pay for material is thinner than I'd have liked,1
"Fit as expected, great savings vs retail store",1
Fitted fit gives a much better drape,1
No tailoring required,1
Quality name brand shirt at a great price,1
Fits just as it should,1
Right on,1
Thank you,1
Just as expected,1
This shirt fit me perfectly and it arrived as expected,1
The neck and sleeve measurements were consistent with my expectations and it looks fine on me,1
Nice shirt,1
I was disappointed because I have ordered this shirt before in this size and evidently the company has changed something in the manufacturing and it is now too snug in the shoulder area,2
Very disappointing,2
Size not even close,2
It fits perfectly if your body is perfectly rectangular,2
Fits well,1
love these shirts,1
Should state in title that it's a fitted shirt very small in the waist,2

The sleeves came down between my wrists and elbows,0
The color was not what I expected,2

This shirt is perfect for a guy who is in good shape,1
It has a nice feel and irons up nicely,1
"This is absolutely, positively not the least bit fitted",0
"If you are thinking of buying this because you are thin or have an athletic build, this is not the shirt for you",2
It was more like a tent than anything resembling a fitted shirt,2
Great shirt for the price,1
I love how crisp the shirt is,1
Much too large,2
"It was 2X , which wasn't expected",2
Came with a little pink dot on the front of the shirt,2

I wore it once  and threw it out sad to say,2
Classy shirt that fits perfectly,1
The fabric used feels a little weird,2
Not so smooth as I would expect,2

Perfect fit,1
It's OK,1
Well worth the price,1
Van Heusen uses good quality cloth,1
Very nice looking after many washes,1
Bought a shirt in Chile same size that fitted me perfectly,1
Ordered this one from the US and it is to large in the arms,2
"Great fit, just as I expected",1
For the price great value,1
Van Heusen is always a good brand,1
Just washed them and wearing them for the second time,0

for the price - excellent shirt,1
nice fitting shirts,1
I  never thought shirts could fit this good,1
I want many more different colors to buy,1
its absolutely fabulous,1
Way too small,2
It is a 16 at most,0
Not an 18 1/2,0
It's somewhat large than I expected,2
size is smaller then it should be so it does not fit,2
sad I really wanted this to fit,2
Love these shirts,1
Fit perfectly,1
bought it as a gift for my boyfriend and he loved the color and fit,1
it was a decent price too,1
This is the most ill-fitting shirt I've ever owned,2
"I generally love Van Heusen dress shirts, especially their slim and fitted lines",1
In no way is this shirt fitted,2
"The sleeves are baggy, the length too long, the fit unflattering, and the collar sloppy",2
I only kept it because I was in a pinch for a suit shirt,2
"To add insult to injury, I got a loose thread on my first wear",2
Do yourself a favor -- go to a brick-and-mortar and try one of these on before you buy,2
A great looking shirt,1
Fits great,1
Fitted? I don't think so,2
Solid shirt,1
Finally I have managed to find shirts that fit well without excess length these will be my go to shirts from now on,1
"Not a ""fitted"" shirt by any means",2
Great shirt,1
For not trying it on and just buying it,0
it fits just like all my other shirts and works for me,1
Without paying the high store price,0
too long,2
Average quality shirt,0
Not exactly slim fit,2
Fitted? Yes,1
A bit too fitted for my big tummy,2
It's even quite a bitter tighter than the Kenneth Cole slim fit shirt I bought,2
Not what I was expecting and too bad because the Van Heusen standard fit shirts give me too much room,2
Where's my happy median?,0
Great product,1

The slimmest fit makes me look like I'm wearig the Jerry Seinfeld pirate shirt and I'm an athletic build 5'11' 200 lbs,0
"As others have mentioned the sleeves are a little billowy and even though it is fitted, those of us skinny guys with long arms are still going to feel like we are swimming in it a bit",2
"Great shirt, fits as expected and I would buy again",1
Well made and good neutral color,1
I think it will wear well,1
Perfect,1
Great shirts although the 'wrinkle free' is obviously hyperbolic,1
I love this shirt so not complaining,1
Van heusen  always fit good to my to my body that's why I by this type of shirt,1

Perfect Dress Shirt,1
It is too small and the color is too dark,2
Hard to find dress shirts that fit well -- until now,0

The one thing I would like is more colors in my size,1
good,1
The shirt feels like plastic,2

And is the best brand out there,1
Good,1
tall husband,0
"I guess that ""fitted"" means slim cut",0
To big not my sige,2
Contours to body very well without being too tight,1
"I don't have as much excess shirt material sticking out from my beltline, which is nice",1
I would not buy these shirts,2
There is something wrong with the fabric,2
There are little oil looking spots in the fabric,2
It has happened on mutiple van huesan shirts I have bought from amazon,0
These spots also do not show up on dress shirts from other makers like geoffery beane which leads me to believe that it is something with the van heusen shirt fabric,0
"Good quality, I got what I bought",1

Great shirt,1
Very nice shirt,1
Fits well,1
my dad liked it alot,1
when i first ordered it i thought the sizing was going to be off,0
dont' order a smaller size or bigger,0
Its not a rip off,0
I bought 2 of these shirts for my bartending job from this company,0
"One is brand new and its perfect, the other has been clearly used because it's faded, super wrinkled, and the armpit area is musty",0
I'm disgusted and appalled that they would send me such a poor item,2
Great Shirt,1
The body is slightly larger than expected for a fitted shirt,2
Great product,1
"I'm 5'9"", 160-165 pounds",0
The fit on the chest and waist was near perfect,1
"All in all, I am giving this shirt a 3 for the untailored sleeves and over-fitted left side",2
It did not disappoint,0
cause it is that size i am looking for and the color much correctly  with suit the shoes tie briefly  it is my perfect size thank you,1
This shirt shouldn't be considered a fitted shirt in any other than it goes in like an hour glass,0
I have a 16- 16 1/2 neck and a 32-33 shoulder,0
The shirt has a 42-46 in waist,0
I'm a 30 in waist,0
How is that considered fitted? I saw no where on the page saying the size range of the waist being that big,2
It fits as well as a tent on the bottom,1
"Happy with the size, fit and durable quality of this shirt",1
"Very soft shirt, washes beautifully",1
"There is nothing like the look of a crisp, brand-new fitted white Van Heusen dress shirt",1
Looks professional with or without a tie,1
Goes with any color slacks,1
ARTICLE ACCORDING TO MY BUYERS,0
Good quality and fits well,1
I think the Van Heusen's poplin dress shirts are a pretty good deal for the money,1
"I don't know how well they fare in the wash, as I always get my shirts laundered at the dry cleaners",0
"The poplin weaving is nice and small, and not too coarse of a fabric",1
White dress shirts with coarse fabric can look cheap,2
Avoid,2
"Van Heusen offers some pretty good size choices, which is important for short, fat man with a thick neck like myself",1
very good,1
"Nice shirt, fits well",1
Dont buy,2
Absolute crap,2
I bought three pair and after a few washes two of the three pair the hems have come undone on the pants legs,0
Don't buy,2
Van Heusen,0
"Even though a lot of americans are obese, I'm sure a large percentage have normal arms",0
The arms on the shirt were humongous,0
I dont recommend if you have a small build like myself,3
The shirt delivered was actually 65% polyester 35% cotton instead of the stated 60% cotton,0
"Otherwise fit was good and accurate to ordered measurements, and color matched as pictured",1
Shirt is exactly as described,1
Fits well with no issues in construction,1
somewhat small and after receiving from cleaners the very first time,2
convinced small,2
so sale really a sale??,0
Fresh,1
There is no way this shirt is an 18,2
5 36/37,0
"I had a guy 5'8"" and 165 lbs who could not evene get into this shirt",0
none,0
I purchased two shirts,0
One was perfectly fine and the other,1
"well, take a look at the photo",0
I carefully removed all the pins like I normally do and noticed two small tears,2
"""You've got to be kidding me,"" I said to myself",2
I will no longer purchase clothing online and especially from Amazon,2
I bought this shirt and one side of the collar was longer than the other side,2
I did not try the shirt on until after the return window had closed,2
This shirt is not wearable and I would like one that is made correctly,2
nice fitting shirts,1
I  never thought shirts could fit this good,1
I want many more different colors to buy,1
its absolutely fabulous,1
"Great fit, nice texture",1
Great work shirt,1
Have been washing this shirt in cold water,0
Took it to dry cleaners once,0
Wore it yesterday and realized that it had shrunk and that the gray dye was coming out of the shirt,2
Have a bunch of other dress shirt,0
of a different brand,0
"that, of course, are having no problems whatsoever",0
Too late to return - it goes in the garbage,2
What a waste of money,2
very BAD,2
I am 5'8'' 150 lbs and ordered the measurements I would normally for a dress shirt,0
Because it was a slim fit I expected it to be a bit tighter everywhere,0
The arms were WAY to large,2
I have a few Van Heusen classic fit shirts and they seemed to have slimmer arms than this one,0
"For the price, this is a good shirt",1
"Because it is inexpensive you could take it to a tailor, get it nice and snug to your liking, and it would still be cheaper than buying a shirt from a department store",1
Pros: The color is great,1
Every guy should have at least one dress shirt of this color,1
Very versatile,1
I took this shirt out of the package the afternoon of my son's homecoming dance to iron it,0
I instantly noticed several greasy stains on the shirt from the back to the front and on the sleeves,2
The stains were several dots tight in a row and down like a 5x5 dotted square,2
Needless to say the shirt was not wearable,2
Thanks for making that day stressful,2
These are the most poorly made shirts I have ever bought,2
Two of these shirts are in the garbage already,2
A complaint to Van Heusen bought no response at all,2
"Do not buy these shirts, they are a complete waste of money",2
Too small for the size,2
"Not what I ordered, now stuck with it",0
Will try to find a friend that can wear it to give it to,0
Shirts arrived on time and were exactly what I wanted,1
"Size, fit and color",0
Good job Amazon,1
"not fitted, basically felt like i was wearing a parachute",2
Perfect,1
Total crap,2
"Very short, poor for",2
Sloppy stitching,2
No more Van Heusen for me,2
Not anywhere near size,2
Great shirt,1
none,0
They are not what I thought that I was getting,2
It's difficult to see the style on the picture and the descriptions all sound the same,2
Have to return and keep searching,2
I love the color and the fit was perfect,1
I was very happy with the actual color of this shirt,1
"The picture shows this to be a turquoise and the description states ""green""",2
I did not want turquoise and took a gamble that the description would be closer to the correct color,2
Imagine blending the turquoise with green,0
The shirt comes closer to being teal,0
Quality is very nice,1
The fit is perfect and true to size,1
5star,1
"I like the shirt,fit and material",1
"Unfortunately, the one they shipped to me was defective and should have been classified in the ""seconds"" bin",2
"Photo attached, collar stitching coming loose right where it shows",2
Will need to donate this one,2
Buyer beware,0
It's never qualified to be fitted,2
Too big in every aspect,2
Bad quality of fabric,2
I already threw it away with the packaged I got,2
The shirt is far too transparent for me in a professional workplace,2
Also the collar stays are sewn in and cannot be taken out,2
"The problem with this is that they are plastic and warp in the laundry, thereby creating a bent collar look that cannot be straightened",2
The cheap price reflects its poor quality in my opinion,2
Great fit,1
I had shop for this specific shirt at several department stores without any luck,0
Similar items run around $45 to $45,0
Amazon provided me with what I was looking for at half the cost,1
It was my mistake,2

"Terrible material, not wrinkle proof, and odd fit",2
"The material is incredibly scratchy, thin and feels like paper",2
"As you can see from the photo, this is not wrinkle proof",2
"This came directly from Amazon, in original packaging",0
I removed the pins and began unfolding and immediately saw the sleeves covered in wrinkles,2
"If they can_ package this to be wrinkle free, how would it stay wrinkle free throughout the day?",2
"As others have mentioned, the fit is off",2
The length of the front and back are longer than any shirt I own,2
The sleeves were longer as well,2
Or if it does fit then it will have imperfections/loose stitching,2
I have a half dozen of these shirts I have bought from department stores over the years,0
I am done trying to buy these shirts without trying them on first,0
"Unfortunately, it is very hard to find them in stores, especially in a variety of colors",0
There seems to have been a run of these prior that had more colors,0
"Plan to tuck these shirts into your pants, since the shirt tails are quite long",2
"I am wearing size 15 with the 32"" sleeves",0
oddly enough size 15 1/2 is a very large difference in size for these and makes them so baggy on me that they are not worth wearing,0
I never cared about the collar style,0
Neck and length are on the mark,0
The fact that this shirt is classified as 'fitted' is ridiculous,2
"Size16 34-35, I'm 6'2"" 195#, athletic build, flat stomach and this thing fits like it was meant for a larger woman 9 months pregnant",2
"Oh well, back to the search for a truly fitted dress shirt",0
I have this shirt in many colors,0
I bought them in the store before I found them on Amazon,0
Fitted works perfectly for me,1
The dimensions fit every over 17 34/35 shirt I own also,0
I simply reorder more when I need them,1
You have to find something that works and looks good,1
Walked the soles of my shoes off trying to locate a store selling a men's shirt size 30/32 with a size 18 neck,0
I found that was impossible,0
I'm so thankful I found this shirt here,1
Fits my boyfriend perfectly,1
I've worn Van Heusen Fitted shirts for years,1
The sleeves and underarm are closer to a Regular Fit,0
15,0
"5, 32""-33""",0
It fit my hubby as expected,1
These shirts are way too short for an average guy,2
"They were either modeled on midgets or designed by women, whatever",2
"too short for a regular guy, almost impossible to keep tucked in",2
Bad design,2
"I expected this brand to be of high quality, and it was",1
I removed one star due to the material,2
"After washing twice,",0
still very difficult to iron out the wrinkles,2
Very very stiff,2
It will probably soften after multiple washings,1
Fits as expected,1
Order this for a medical conference take it out of the pack a week later found out that the sleeve is 6 in too short what the hell were they thinking do not buy this it is a waste of your time and money that you're just going out to return it,2
"Hard to find color, just what I had been looking for",2
"Great Van Heusin quality, thicker fabric than other named brands",1
This is a great shirt,1
Great replacement of my old work shirts,1
Shirt came in with a hole in the sleeve,2
it_ a fitted cut and sleeves feel short,2
If no hole in sleeve would have kept shirt,0
This one will be returned,2
Perfect fit,1
Just how I like it,1
Fine product,1
The shirt is a really nice style and fits as requested,1
Great price too,1
The shirt is great I gave it two stars because we were sent the fitted and not classic size,2
Love the shirts otherwise,1
The shirt fit perfectly,1
My boyfriend wears a 42 jacket and has a 33 waist,0
The slim fit shirts are too tight in the chest,2
Good quality for the price,1
Fitted as expected like other fitted ans athletic fit shirts,1
Lovely fits very well thank you,1
Very impressed with the shirt,1
very nice feel to it,1
I was also pleasantly surprised to find it on Amazon for about half the cost of what I would find in a local department store,1
Very happy with the purchase,1
When you need a white dress shirt that fits as listed in the description summary look no further,1
I will buy this shirt again for my ration collection,1
I do think the quality will run down fast if wash too oftern,2

The tapering isn't extreme and doesn't require a bodybuilder's physique,0
"To all the reviewers out there that claim this shirt is ""too sheer"":  Don't blame the shirt for your inability to properly dress yourself",0
ALL white dress shirts are designed and required to be worn with an undershirt,0
"Don't be stupid, dress like a man",0
"The one thing that keeps it from 5 stars is even as a fitted shirt, it's still pretty loose around the cage",2
I'd hate to see what the regular fit looks like,2

One of the worst wrinkle free shirts that I ever got,2
"Fits good, good quality",1
"This shirt was way too large, it fit more like a graduation gown than a dress shirt",2

I recently lost about 50lb and still loosing weight,0
Was 205lb wearing large shirt with mediums fitting tight,0
I still use the large and medium dress shirts for work,0
I looked at the sizing charts and thought medium would be decent,0
"I have a chest of 39"" and a waist of 32""",0
"remember to size up to make a shirt not feel skin tight 2-3"" for tighter fit, 4 - 5 regular fit, 6+ baggy",0
"Sizing up would put me at a shirt size around chest 43"", waist 36""",0
Comparing what I thought of the sizes to my current clothes I thought a medium would fit fine,0
It was a bit big and a loose fit,2
I did a lot of shrinking on the shirt to reduce the size as much as possible,2
I got it down to probably a size in between a small and medium,0
I would say a good iron session to the the pre package lines in the shirt out is a necessity,0
The creases that are out of the package make the shirt look really big and baggy,2
So to get a true idea on how it fits I would say wash and ironing will get you a more true look to the shirt,0
The after shrinking shirt didn't feel like a slim fit more regular fit,0
which I expected,0
I ordered another shirt in a small to see if I like the fit better,0
"Overall the quality, feel, and look of the shirts is nice",1
Only complaint is the waist doesn't look as advertised and will need to be fitted by a tailor or DIY,2
"After reading other reviews about it being ""small"" ""tighter than usual"" ""not American shirt sizes"" I decided to order up",0
Totally unnecessary,2
"I like wearing an athletic style shirt that generally tappers in a little at the waist, and that's exactly how this shirt fits",0
"With that out of the way, the shirt is nice",1
"Overall, very satisfied with the purchase",1
I got my husband the 3x shirt,0
It's a cute shirt,1
"Actually fits as expected, perhaps a tad small",1
"I need XL, ordered XXL and it fits well",1
"Unfortunately, XXL is available in limited colors",2
"I get plenty of compliments, wish there were more options",1
I'd buy more if the options were there,1
"NOTE: the pocket is decorative, you cannot put sunglasses etc",2
in there,0
"Honestly it's very soft, very comfortable",1
I will be buying more,1
ot fits great,1
Looks great and feels great,1
Both my husband and I loved this shirt,1
"Not the type of shirt we see often, especially in stores",0

"If you wear a 2X, then you'll need to buy a 3X or even 4X, frankly",0
"If you're normally a medium, you'll want to buy an XL",0
I'm at best a 3XLT,0
normally a bit roomy,0
and the 4XL just barely fit,0
"Second, this isn't denim",0
It's a regular fabric dressy shirt with a denim look to it,0
"About the product itself, I like Coofandy because they take fairly regular dress shirts and style them up with contrasting sleeves and colors, these small details that really makes the shirts ""pop"" over the plain old dress clothes",0
"Likewise, they are dirt cheap considering the last set of designer dress shirts I bought with similar styles were over $80",0
"As long as you can wade through their sizing and other weirdisms and realize you're buying an expensive looking shirt on the cheap, these are a really great deal",0
When I received the package I looked the shirt over and did not see any flaws,1
The stitching seems solid,1
So far I like the shirt and think its well worth the money,1
Fits perfectly,1
This shirt arrived on time and was actually very nicely made,1
The large fit my husband perfectly,1
"6' 3"" tall and 205 pounds",0
"The red, white &amp",0
blue checkerboard that showed on the inside of the cuffs and collar made it perfect to wear for the 4th of July,0
This shirt is a sport fit and is very flattering on my husband,0
"The material is thick in a positive way, better intended for warmer climates",1
It feels well richer than its low price,1
We will definitely be purchasing another in a different color,1
Good looking shirt &amp,1
fit,1
Excellent fabric,1
Easy to wash and iron,1
Holds it's shape,1
One drawback,2
no side pocket,2
It's still a 5 Star shirt,1
JR,0
I bought this shirt for my son_ senior pictures and he loves it,1
It photographs perfectly,1
OK so the shirt looks really nice,1
I gave it a full star because it really does look nice if you can fit it,1
I decided to keep the shirt and wear it open with a under shirt that's how much I like it,1
The material is nice and heavy should last for some time,1
The color is right on the money matches the picture,1
The sizing is good as well specially because as a slim guy myself it has a nice fitted looked without being too tight,1
60 170lbs,0
Some of the Coofandy shirts are  cotton others are denim,0
I_e ordered many of each over 6 months,0
50% of the large are way to big on me the other half fit me perfectly,0
"If you like keeping warm, this shirt is for you",1
The fabric is HARD,2
I don't know if it will get better with multiple washes or remain rough,2
It doesn't hang on your body,2
It will stiffly puff up along the small of your back,0
The design is the only thing saving this shirt and making me keep it,1
I read so many reviews saying that the size is smaller than US and so I went with one size larger,0
some reviews said go with two,0
"Well, it is large",2
"The way the shirt looks in the pictures, it is not fitted like that",2
It is a straight shirt which you cannot compare with the fitting from any of the better brands,1
even American Eagle etc,0
"This is more like a straight fit, something like CK you get from sales at Macy's for your dad",0
"It you actually roll the sleeves up more than one fold, you're not going to see that pattern",0
In case that's important to you,0
Pretty decent shirt for the office though,1
Thin material,0
and it fits pretty much as you'd expect from typical American sizing standards,0
"even though ""men's large"" tends to be the most inconsistent gamble of a pick",0
The shirt is tapered very slightly,0
"The shirt fit well at chest and shoulders, with actually more room than expected for a small",1
size runs large,2
Not a true slim fit as advertised,2
I won_ buy any others even tho I love the look of the shirt,2
This is a really good looking shirt,1
It_ a very sturdy jeans type of material,0
A caution though,2
"I was ironing the shirt so my husband could wear it and when I ironed over the pocket with the leather accent, the heat actually took the fake leather off living it rather odd looking",2
That was upsetting since it had never even been worn yet,2
I_ 64 265lbs with long arms,0
The 4xl shirt fit fine,1
If I would have gotten the 3xl it would have been too small,0
"The material, The color",0
Extremely stylish and different,1
I knew when I tried it on it had swag,1
I recommend it no problems,1
I wear an XXL sized shirt,0
"T-shirts, polo shirts, dress shirts",0
I have for years,0
"Based on a few comments, I ordered size XXXL",0
3XL,0
It is at least TWO sizes smaller than an XXL,0
Might be a Large at best,0
Buyer be aware,2
Good fit,1
The large is just right,1
Not too tight,1
I normally wear a large,0
"Be advise there is no pocket, although it looks like a pocket slot in the pictures, the slot is just a fake leather borderd slot",2
Works great when left hanging out,1
Works ok if you want to tuck it in,1
The color blue is good and I like the inside trim at the color and the cuffs,1
"As soon as I received the item, my husband opened the package, pulled out the shirt and as soon as he did that there was a funky odor that came from the material of the shirt",2
"When he tried on the shirt, the length in the front was short and the pockets was extremely small",2
"When he went to take the shirt off, he noticed his hands was blue like the shirt",2
It seem to have a really cheap clothing dye with a cheap strong odor,2
"It does seem to be a very nice shirt, just way too short for me",0
"I'm 6'3"" and the shirt was about 3-4"" too short, the tail barely came down to my waist",0
If they sold these in tall sizes I'd definitely get another one,0
All in all the shirt fits okay at best,1
I would have preferred a slim fit version,0
which tapers off to the waist,0
of a M size - I also ordered the M size and the M waist is big enough to fit a small pillow in with me,1
No idea who the design for _egular is for,2
The M arm length was perfect,1
Please release a slim/athletic fit version of your shirts,1
Regular waist is completely oversized,2
Great heavy weight nice looking shirt,1
"I ride a motorcycle in Colorado, so I_ always looking for fashionable, and heavy extra layers ya know? This is exactly that",1
Looks great,1
"If you want it tight get your size , if you want it to fit _ormal",0
a little loose,2
and I guess correct get a size Up,0
Its cheaply made feels like toilet paper to be honest,2
New rule if your buying on amazon and shipping takes longer then a week it's cheap chinese knockoff,2
Also another thing there no branding on this at all only thing here is the XL on the inner stitching that's it no i,0
d number or anything,0
I purchased this shirt in a XX-Large size,0
"The sleeve length was fine, just the shirt was way to small",1
I wear a 4xl,0
They sent an xs,0
the color fit and style seemed to have matched the picture,1
I sent it back,2
amazon handled the return,0
"I bought this for my son because he is always looking for something ""different""",0
He appreciates the details on this shirt,1
Mine was as close to slim-fit as it could get without being marketed as slim-fit,0
I was afraid of that based on 99% of this store's items being slim-fit,0
Will be returning,2
The black was pretty shiny too,0
"I bought this after digesting all the reviews as a gift, and lo and behold, the gentleman said that it was extremely comfortable and unusual and fitted well",1
He kept calling and giving compliments about the shirt,1
then asked me which store I got it from and places a request that he wants a green one,1
Lol,1
When I buy a gift and it makes the person happy,1
then my job is done,0
__,0
"The vendor responded, encouraging me to keep the item",0
Why would I want to keep something that does not fit??,2
Best Choice was ultimately my Worst Choice to buy from,2
I Will avoid making another purchase at all costs from this vendor,2
I dont put perfect beacuse for some reason after wash the water gets a lor of blue color on in,2
it did not fade so not sure what was it,0
The color is gorgeous,1
The fit is perfect,1
"The fabric, though suggested to be lightweight, I find it sturdier than light",0
"don't know how it'll do in the summer, as it was procured in the winter",0
It's well made and very attractive,1
Highly recommend,1
"I wear a small slim fit from Gap, Old Navy or Express",0
I bought a small in this shirt,0
Planning to return,2
"Would order a different size if there were a smaller one available, it's a nice shirt",0
Great for the price and quality was also good,1
I ordered a larger size to be safe,0
Sorry I had to return it,2
I looked at the reviews and sizing chart and a 3xl should have been fine,0
"It's not, the shirt is tight around my middle",2
It's sad really because I really like the shirt,2
I hope it shrinks up just a bit,0
I?셫 5?? 185,0
Mostly in shape,1
It fits perfect,1
Literally fits me the way it looks on the picture,1
"I'm 5'10"" and 200lbs",0
"Athletic as I train Jiu Jitsu, and workout 3-5 days a week",0
Size Medium was perfect,1
I just followed the sizing guide they have,0
This is the second shirt I bought from them ?쨿?뤌,1
I usually wear my shirt untucked and sleeves rolled up which is how this shirt is meant to be worn,0
Definitely recommend,0
Great quality shirt,1
Great material and perfect fit,1
Shirts do run small so definitely go up a size,2
"I got this for someone who?셲 usually an snug XL, I got him a XXL and that size fit snugly on him",1
The pocket shown on the left chest is a false pocket,0
Had ordered a XXL i typically wear an XL,0
Figured because its online I would order bigger just incase it was too small,0
Well sadly it was still too small,2
An XXL is probably a large maybe a medium,0
"So its been returned, more than likely will not buy from the company again since im apparently fat",2
Was NOT impressed by the Quality of the Shirt particularly around the Collar,2
"Shirt Fits Well for XLarge  16""neck 35/36"" sleeve  6'3 approx",1
200lbs,0
Will wear it with a crew or turtle neck lightweight shirt/sweater and should look nice,1
I was really disappointed when this shirt came in,2
It's a beautiful shirt and I really wanted it for my wardrobe,1
Perfect style for work and home,1
I purchased an XXL and when I tried it on it didn't fit,2
My Fiance wears an American Large and it didn't fit him either,2
I would absolutely buy this product again if it was offered in correct sizes for the US consumer,1
"After looking at the picture again, it definitely looks as though they've pinned the shirt in the back to make it look tailored or slim fit",1
Now I have to pay to have it tailored or just return the item,2
"Really like the fit, color, and style of the plaid inner sleeves",1
Probably my favorite dress shirt to wear now,1
The shirt looks great very nice,1
Make sure to order bigger than you would normally order,0
Not great,2
The collar just looks cheap,0
Fit is accurate though,1
A quality made shirt,1
Material is not flimsy,0
Good sturdy denim,1
"Has a great fit, and looks great",1
I even paired it with a Tweed necktie and it looks great,1
I plan on buying a few others in different colors,1
Highly recommended,1
Get a lot of complaints with this shirt,2
Looks good,1
Great for client meetings and going out on the town,1
This shirt was surprisingly comfortable,1
I normally don't shop online for clothes because of fit and feel issues,2
I don?셳 like the material so hard not soft,2
Decent shirt,1
Got the all black one,1
"If you are a heavier guy, get a size up, you can pull it off",0
Its going to fit like a glove,1
"Stand up straight, shoulders back, activate your core - this is a trendy, metro, ""in the club"" style shirt",1
"You don't tuck this in and wear it to a board meeting, you don't wear this to your cousin's wedding, etc",2
"It's flashy, it's tight fitting, that's the style",1
Very nice quality,1
This shirt is light weight and is very nice looking in person,1
I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loved it,1
I especially loved the check print around the collar,1
It was a nice touch instead of just a plain jean shirt,1
Very nice,1
It has a nice fit and was an excellent deal,1
Way too big,2
I got a large and it was huge so I ordered a medium and it ended up being very tight,2
Thier sizes make no sense at all,2
I purchased 2,1
Does not look much like picture,2
Material feels cheap,2
Didn?셳 feel worth the price,2
Full refund when I returned both of them,2
It is blue,0
Really well made shirt,1
Bought for my husband and he loved it,1
"Fit as expected, great quality, and looks like it will last a long time",1
Wash with dark colors or alone the first time because the blue color will transfer,0
Be wary when you order,2
I ordered the black version of this shirt and love it,1
I got this one because I love that one so much and the material is ENTIRELY different,1
The material difference makes it fit much different and resulted in me returning it,2
Disappointed,2
I was not stretching the shirt out it just simply broke off to cheap sewing,2
maybe I'm a little too big lol since I'm a little on the heavy side outside if that it's a great looking shirt,2
I definitely recommend it,1
i had some issues that were soon resolved by the provider,0
the shirt looks good,1
The shirt was way bigger than expected,2
I ordered a small and the shirt was baggy and really long,2
I?셫 5ft7,0
The shirt feels cheap,0
Doesn't say it,0
My daughters have told me I need more casual dress shirts,2
So when I came out of my room styling this shirt they screamed with joy,1
The fit is perfect and the feel is even better,1
"The colors are dynamic, the deep blue and the contrast",1
Don't pass this one up,1
"I'm 6'1"", 235lbs, and the XL was my choice",1
"I am 5'10 180 lbs and fit, the waist is could be pulled in a few inches",0
A small would be too tight in the chest and arms,2
Need more styles,0
Love this one,1
Not just the plain old shirt,0
Uniqueness is great,1
Creative shirts at last,1
This is a really nice looking shirt,1
Good value,1
My son loved this shirt I bought it for his senior portraits and he's received so many compliments the colors really popped,1
"First off, upon opening the package it had a super strong chemical odor",1
The material is extremely thin,0
which I actually wanted,1
and all I can say about the sizing is that it runs extremely small,0
It?셲 unfortunate that so many online retailers are selling clothing that?셲 not accurate as far as sizing is concerned,2
I?셪l just give this shirt to the local homeless shelter as it?셲 just a waste of my time to send it back,2
Nice shirt and even recieved a compliment on how it looked,1
Seems to be of a fair quality that will last,1
If it doesn't I will update my listing as always,2
It is comfortable and warm,1
Not my favorite shirt it fits fine,2
It looks like a really cheap denim and the fake leather on the pocket looks bad,2
Probably would not have bought it if I had seen it in person,2
I ordered a 2x for my boyfriend,0
It was too small,2
It?셲 his usual size,0
I would suggest going a size up,0
The fit was great,1
Love the design of this shirt,1
The khaki color is not khaki- it?셲 a green/grey,2
Definitely not what I was expecting,2
Medium fit my husband well,1
Very disapointed,2
"Cheap fabric, poor stitching and about 1 1/2 sizes small",2
Size chart for measurments seems way off,2
Shoulders are tiny,2
Deffinatly not made for someone with broad shoulders or a built chest,2
Normaly wear a large ordered an extra large and i still feel i would rip this shirt in half at the shoulders if i wear it,2
Fits as expected,1
Loved the fabric is pretty bold,1
"in color, in looks, in durability, and comfort",1
I wear an XL,0
It fit as expected for me,1
I would say the size fits perfectly for me,1
"5'8"" -- 160lbs male -- small fits me perfect , not too loose not tight",1
Styling is on point with this,1
"Be sure to wash it first, or you will get blue all over everything",0
a lot,0
It's to the point where I don't even wear it now,2
Awesome shirt- love this brand,1
Tends to run a bit large or small even though I always get the same size for my man,2
"Product is glittery, not at all the denim like fabric shown in the preview",2
I expected a dark blue fabric and got one that?셲 nearly purple and sparkles,2
I will never wear this,2
The fabric was quite thick and synthetic'ish would not recommend for summertime,2
"I am returning it and ordering the next size up because it seems like a nice shirt, good fabric, looks good",1
This is exactly what my brother was looking for,1
meets all his expectations and more,1
"The color is great, neatly sewn, material is very light for the summer",1
Short looks and fits very good,1
I?셶e only worn it once,2
Awful fabric,2
Feels like the type of fabric that you would use a a awning for a RV,2
Unlike any fabric that I have ever felt,0
Color is a bit darker comparing to the picture at Amazon,0
Ultramarine blue,0
"Material is soft and a little stretchy, I love it",0
Fits as expected,1
Definitely would buy it again,1
Didn?셳 say in the description that the shirt is slim fit when I ordered,2
Said true to size so I did and now I?셫 fighting back and forth with the company,1
Fits a bit more snug,0
"Quality is ok , ?몟?뤌",0
Thick material for fall or winter,0
My wife really liked how this shirt fit and looked on me,1
I will buy more in different colors,1
Item was much too large and bulky,2
Awkward and stiff shirt,2
Not worth the money,2
Go to JCPenney or something and get a good deal for a better shirt,2
THis product is way too expensive for what it is,2
I literally had to sit with sewing scissors and carefully remove all the extra fabric strings,2
I have to be honest the quality isn't that great it's alittle on the cheap side,2
So,0
I wear 3xl to 4XL all the time,0
I ordered the 4XL  and the length wasn?셳 even CLOSE to fitting,2
"super disappointed, I liked the design very much",2
My son absolutely love the shirt looks real nice on him,1
Runs very fitted,1
I was disappointed that it had a fake chest pocket,2

It is true to size,0
My husband loves this shirt and I love seeing him in it,1
"Great quality, very durable at a great price",1
Got a medium for my husband and it's quite big compared to other mediums,0
"I expected it to be longer from the picture, the length just barely fits my 6ft tall husband",0
"I?셫 5????- 145 lbs kinda slim, I went with the medium and it fits me just fine",1
Fits perfectly and would highly suggest purchasing a size up,1
Very nice quality and love the contrast,1
I was disappointed with the sizing,2
I got the largest size for Hubby and it was still to small,2
Received wrong color selection,2

It came on time,1

They are using Asian sizing,0
I thought the shirt had a pocket have it on the atrium that looks like a pocket,0
This is a beautiful shirt I love it,1

4xl would be a 2x I think,2
Decent shirt,1
just too small,2
Material is thick and heavy,2
it feels more like a jacket then a shirt,0
Great shirt fits well and the opposite sex loves it,1
I ordered and XXL even though I west an XL,0
I did that due to past experiences,0
"Great looking shirt, great value, too",1
"Fit well, not baggy to achieve the length",1
I'm tall so that's typically a problem,0
"6'2"" 195lb and L fit perfect",1
We'll see how it holds up once I wash it,0
"I absolutely love thisz it's my favorite shirt that I own, just too bad I don't go out much to use it",1

He is 6foot 2 and about 205 lbs,0
I ordered him a 2x,0
and it looked just like the photo,1
I am normally wearing an XL shirt and it fits lose on me,0
I ordered this shirt to layer over a T shirt during football games this fall,0
XXL was way to small for this,0
Would have even been tighter than I would have wanted  for a single shirt,2
Only good thing was it was a nice looking shirt,1
Bonita pero la tela es muy gruesa,0
So cute,1
My teen son really likes it,1
I like it?셲 not a t-shirt,0

This shirt is ok,0
Looks and fits just how I would expect it?셲 just a ok shirt,0
Nothing bad to say about it,0
If I had one problem it would be the material looks a little metallic instead of jean like,2
Perfect work shirt for WINTER,1
The material is strong and flexible with a very comforting feeling,1
I?셫 definitely getting more,0
I prefer a thinner work shirt for those hot days,0
"Great item ,just sent wrong size,my roommate wanted it though",1
really wanted it,1
I'm sure this product is right for some,1
It was not my preferred style,2
The color was much lighter than the photos and the material change to plaid was harsher than I had thought,1
"Quality wise, It was fine",1
Not as much gray as the picture looks way more denim look,0
Has a rough textured feal with a plastic coating its just off,2
"I liked everything about the shirt except how big it ran, even for a small it look like a large, I wore it as a birthday gift to myself",1
"It is a very good looking shirt,it fits very well, it is warm and comfortable",1
I highly reccomend it,1
I now have two of them,1

"I am 6'4"" and 220 lbs, XL is perfect",1
"True to size , great quality and looks amazing on",1
I ordered a large and the tag on the collar of the shirt has an m and the paper tag that comes on every shirt has a m sticker way too small,0
Scratchy on the arms,1
I went up a size just Incase it was a small cut shirt and when I got it in it was a size too small,2
If I picked my size it would have been 2 sizes too small,2

Ok,0
like,0
These shirts stink,2

The shirt is a nice fabric and is very good looking,1
Very nice shirt,1
"Tela de mediana calidad, se ve bonito, tela aspera",0
Just get a size up and itll fit perfect,0
My son needed a shirt for a funeral in 2 days,0
It made it,0
Do not believe that this is bigger than normal or true to size,2
"I have a 52"" chest and this shirt fit like a large",0
I would have needed a 4x to get this around my chest,0
The shirt was not the same color as shown and the material was very stiff and hard,2
The plus is it did fit,1
Not expected quality,0
Go the same price you can get a great shirt at Dillards,2
"If you wear mediums and larger then its for you, if you are a small guy, then it will be to big",0
I'm returning it,2
Too bad they don't make XS or XXS,2
"Great shirt for the price, materials are stretchy just enough for the change in body composition",1
Shirt is way oversized at the waist,2
It looks nicer on the picture than it really is,1
Fabric is kinda thick,0
Turned out that it would fit my 15 year old son who normally wears an adult medium or large,0
I like it and look good to me,1
It looks good and is cheap,1

Bought this denim shirt for my son,0
He is 6' tall and weighs about 140,0
The size Sm fit him perfectly,1
The checked cuffs and the leather pocket trim adds a nice little accent to the shirt,1
This shirt is a little dressier than the normal denim shirts that I've seen,0
Other denim shirts seem to hang looser and seem sloppier in appearance,2
This denim is nice enough to be worn out to dinner to meet your future in-laws,1
Just my opinion,0
Taki,0
Other than that shirt is super fresh and steeze level is high,1
Stamp of approval,1
Shirt is made of nice material and looks good,1
A few problems though,2
"I'm 5'9"" 160",0
Shirt is way baggy around the abdomen and fits loose,2
"I dislike shirts that are too short and it feels like that is a problem with this shirt, even though they cut it to have somewhat of a tail in the back",2
"If you are around my height or shorter and about 175ish, this shirt would fit you well in Medium",0
True to size,1
material somewhat low quality,2
Just got it perfect fit buy it you wont regret for this price fast shipping don't know what else i could ask for thanks seller,1
It seems to run small,2
Nice material and good color and the shirt fit across the shoulders and my arms just fine,1
I bought this Shirt twice,1
"The first time it was good, nice soft material and perfect cut",1
The second time was awful,2
"Poor material, poorly cut",2
When I wear it feels like I am wearing sand grinding my skin,2
"WAY TOO SMALL - Men's large did not fit my 14 year old, 120 Lb 5'8"" son",2
Should of payed attention to other peoples reviews,0
If your looking for a more fitted wear,0
This aint the shirt for ya,0
Looks good,1
DO NOT BUY,2
I ordered a large and it was so small I could not even get it on,2
Also threads were coming out of the shirt,2
Very very cheaply made so not buy it's not worth the money,2
Also made in China,2
Nice shirt,1
Nice Shirt,1
"good shirt, recommend seller",1
Small,2
Cheap material,2
excellent value,1
Ignore the comments about it running small,0
It ran too large and it's super loose now,0
I ordered a medium hoping it'd be smaller,0
The shirt is good quality though,1
Also that isn't a real pocket,2
Fit Well,1
Nice material and style,1
It's not slim fit,0
Nice,1
The sizing chart is not accurate,2
"I ordered size according to chart and it was way too small, this shirt would most likely fit a teenage boy or very small man",2
Was very disappointing after how little it took to receive the item,2
My husband loves it,1
I measured my chest and determined through the size chart that large was the size for me,0
When I received the shirt I quickly realized it was too small,2
To large and my order was small that small is large for me,2
Thumbs up,1
"What you see is what you get , good quality, fits perfect",1
Love this shirt,1
Way too small,2
"As a stage performer, this shirt's style fit what I was looking for",1
minus 1 star,2
It would have been impossible to match it,2
I bought matching thread and sewed it back on no problem,0
Love it,1
A tad small,2
Good,1
"this size is so far off ,i can't beleive how far off they are",2
",what it would cost me to return it plus all the paper work ill just through the freakin thing away,I PROMISE YOU I WILL NEVER BUY A ITEM FROM THIS WEBSITE PLUS  I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND YOUR PRODUCT '' IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN''",2
"If you've ordered other shirts by this manufacturer, you'll know that their sizes are a bit hit or miss depending on the style",2
"It's difficult to determine if it's going to fit, even after careful measurement",2
"For this shirt, at 195# and 6'0, if you have really any upper body muscle, an XL is critical",0
It's not a comfortable situation,2
"Otherwise, good quality and looks good",1
Order a size up,0
Shirt looks like it is slightly fitted it is not at all,2
May be good for some not acceptable for me,2
"I am 175, consider normal to thin, and 6ft",0
"Large was too small in length, XL too big in width",2
Plaid strip on edge of shirt shows when you sit down,2
Otherwise it's a nice looking shirt,1
so it looks pretty cool,1
"it is thicker than anticipated, it looked much thinner in the pictures",0
the pocket is nonfunctional,2
"my biggest complaint, and why I am returning it is that I am 6ft, athletic at 190lbs and a Large always fits me well and allows me to show a little form",2
the display picture shows exactly how I wanted it to look on me,1
there is no size I could purchase to get the look of the model picture- medium sleeves and length would be too short,2
will be avoiding this product maker for this horrible sizing reason,2
Wow,1
"Beautiful shirt, very well made, it fits like a glove",1
I bought for my boyfriend and it couldn't fit any better,1
I'm going to buy three more,1
For the price it's unbelievable quality,1
"Decent quality, only problem is that they stitched this ugly plaid onto the collar so that it makes you look like the kid from A Christmas Story",2
?ㄲ?ㄾ,0
Total throw away shirt,2
Falls apart after first wear,2
"DO NOT buy this shirt,quality is really bad,color isn't what is described",2
Save your money and buy something better,2
"It?셲 labeled as a slim fit shirt, it?셲 not",2
I?셫 6????and 265 with big shoulders and arms so I ordered the 4XL,0
The length of the shirt barely passes my belt,0
The amount of extra room around the torso could make another shirt,0
I love this shirt,1
I immediately took it out of the package and tried it on,0
I have plenty of room to move and it?셲 not overly fitted anywhere,2
I?셪l definitely be buying more in other colors,1
I have an athletic build and I like that this shirt is tailored to the waist area,0
I was impressed by the thick quality of the material,2
"Warning, this shirt runs at least one size small, maybe even two sizes",0
Very disappointing,2
I was given this for Christmas and cannot even wear it,2
This runs pretty small as far as we're concerned,2
Won't fit,2
VERY tight,2
Does not run true to size,2
"Also, the material was kind of thin",2
And the leather looking pocket was rather cheap looking too,2
ran a little small to allow for shrinkage so ordering size up,0
will give other to my son,0
Seems to be very good quality,1
Our son in law loved it,1
I loved the shirt,1
I bought it for my boyfriend who is normally a large and it was really wide in the belly,1
Everything else seemed to be good,1
Very light shirt,2
Kind of disappointed,2
Bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday and the material is shiny,2
Yuck,2
I returned this item,2
"I normally wear an xl, I ordered a 3XL based  on the measurements on the sizing chart",0
"It still came small, this shirt isn't cut consistently with the measurements even on the sizing chart",2
Really disappointed,2
Its ok,1

My husband wears a M and this shirt we got was a L,0
it was HUGE,2
We will be getting a return then ordering this same shirt again,1
"I'm 5'11, 150 lbs, slim build",0
It's a great looking shirt in theory and I bought the large by accident first,1
My brother tried it on and it looked good on him,1
He's bigger than me so I figured I'd just get it in small,0
It's extremely wide and looks nothing like the picture showed on the mannequin/display pic,2
Overall I'm disappointed,2
Not sure if I'll keep it yet,2
I might see if it shrinks a little in the dryer,0
This is super short on me and a little snug I wear a 3xl tall and this shirt is like a half shirt on me and I'm not extremely tall 6'2 so it's going back,2
"The shirt is awesome, it?셲 well made with excellent color and attention to detail",1
Just be sure to order two sizes up,0

basic with few extras,0
but pretty good,1
it fits as expected and is comfortable,1
but there are some minor finish issues and it lacks what other shirts in this range have,2
it also doesn't have a hanging loop,2
but i don't care about that,0
so the back is a plain back which is not a problem for me,0
"but for some, who wear this to work and want a more finished look it may be an issue",2
if you're wearing it under a coat no problem of course,0
but you'll have to take it off sometime :-d,0
so it isn't visible,0
but can be felt,2
"most of them were simply loose pieces and pulled right out,",2
i'd give it 5 stars,1
but for the few little issues i mention,2
but not hot and heavy either,1
"i have not worn them with a tie yet,",2
but not too tightly,2
i rarely dress up,2
but am going to a relative's wedding where i'll have to wear a coat and tie to 2 different events,0
"i do have an older,",0
"but nice, blazer and needed to build a wardrobe around it",0
"although i haven't worn it anywhere yet,",0
but it fits great and looks good,1
"i wore this shirt 1 time, then i washed it on a cold gentle cycle, delicate dryer both are large capacity,",2
"but i only washed 1 other shirt, and 2 pairs of pants and both cuff sleeves have completely fallen apart",2
"i am not sure if i can get my money back,",2
"but i can prevent someone else from buying the terrible product, then i have done my job",2
even doing this they are hard to iron to get all of the wrinkles out and after wearing for a little,2
while they look like you have slept in them,0
"the sleeves are not 34"",",0
but it is an ok shirt,1
"i usually roll up my sleeves and i might make a mending project out of it,",0
but i shouldn???have to,0
"however, it had a lot of loose threads",2
i took care of it,0
but it was a nuisance,2
but would definitely consider getting the waist and sleeves tailored,2
"the quality of stitching isn't superb,",2
but adequate,1
they say easy care,0
but they are heavily wrinkled straight out of the drier,2
i always iron them,2
but it is much easier with a shirt that already looks pretty good,2
the shirt fit great,1
but one of the seams ripped out after 6 months of little wear,2
"brought these shirts for my husband, he has broad shoulders so it fitted well there",1
but waist area was abit loose,2
"it would be good for others to wear at anytime,",1
but he is a tee shirt kind of guy so i needed a comfy and easy care shirt,0
but i doubt it will stand up well to repeated laundering,2
not super well made,2
but for the price a good shirt,1
this shirt was the same size,0
but was a lot bigger,0
it will do,0
but not satisfied with the size,2
"i find it very difficult to find good dress shirts with a 18 inch collar and 34-35 sleeve,",0
but these exactly fit the bill,1
unlike the same model,0
but has pinpoint on the collar,0
"but maybe, after a wash, they'll be just right",0
"but not see-through, either",2
nice fit,1
but a lot of loose threads hanging out all over the shirt,2
"needed a tall,",2
but the shirt is quality,1
comfortable,1
but not long enough,2
these shirts were a great value,1
but they come out of the dryer wrinkled,2
"a neat and hard to find color pattern,",2
but be prepared to get the iron out,2
"i love this shirts,",1
"but as they are too small for my husbands neck, i am returning and ordering a larger size",2
material is not the greatest like tommy hilfiger shirts,2
but it is right for the price,1
"i should have returned it prior to the cut off time,",2
but unfortunately i procrastinated,2
great quality,1
but too long and loose around waist,2
not bad,0
"but it is a bit loose , buy half a size smaller than your actual size , quality is good and very comfortable , packiging and delivery were excellent",0
i got one,0
but the size is completely not fitting for me,0
i thought about reaching out to the manufacturer before posting a review,2
but really they should do quality testing before they ship these things out,2
"nice looking dress shirt,",1
but needs to be ironed ???0,2
"a little too wide, it is a regular fit",0
but still a little wide even for that,2
"it fit as expected,",0
"but as a tall person it is a tad shorter than i want,",0
but not so bad that it renders the shirt unwearable,0
would've given it 5 stars,1
but the sleeve length was just a tad short,0
but acceptable,0
however it is wa to big around the abdominal area,2
nice shirt,1
but i wish it really was a 16 1/2 x 33,0
fit amazing,1
but had a small whole on the sleeve,2
normally i???pretty happy with van heusen /amazon clothes,1
but i just bought this shirt and there were over a dozen loose threads/strings that i had to cut off,2
"it's a nice shirt,",1
"but all of my husband's other shirts are from l l bean, and the van heusen shirt is not of that quality",0
"ok shirt,",1
but it is smaller than other shirts i have with the same size,0
he really liked the shirt,1
but it is not made well,2
nice shirt,1
it's also soft,1
"but ""manly""",0
i opened today,0
but there are a lot defaults,2
"material was nice,",1
but it was little bit large so i had to return it,2
5 in size,0
but it was bit large with this brand,0
i have written favorable reviews about van heusen dress shirts because i,1
"but them all the time due to fit, looks, ease of care, and price",0
not truly wrinkle free does need ironing after washing,2
but does not wrinkle,0
while wearing,0
its like slim fit,1
but not so slim,0
thin material,0
but a good shirt for the price and good for quickly and cheaply adding depth to a wardrobe,1
"i was looking for a fitted dress shirt,",1
but only regular fit was available,0
"shirt fit well,",1
"but just a bit wide in the mid drift, even for a classic cut",0
"it was a nice looking shirt and my husband has a lot of van heusen shirts that fit great if we get the right size,",0
but somehow the size i thought i ordered was not the right size,2
great casual,1
but squared away look,0
"good looking and fits well,",1
but its the second shirt received with frayed sleeves,2
"not much to say,",0
but a good buy,1
but it's good for the ol' 9-5,0
"more costly then i usually spend on a dress shirt,",1
but it was easy to order and it works,1
but does need ironing,2
"dad loves these shirts,",1
"but at 92 his turkey neck was causing issues, so we had to up size",0
love the shirt,1
but the neck is too small,2
"one pocket, it was a little baggy",2
but otherwise good shirt,1
must iron after wash,2
but good material,1
stripes are very crisp,0
but not overly bright,0
a little loose,2
but after a few washes it should be just fine,0
this appears to be a well made shirt,1
but it is certainly not no-iron,2
i normally wear a 15 1/2 33-34,0
but of course they didnt have this size when i ordered,0
the sleeves seems to be a bit long,0
but not enough to request alteration or return,0
but so far so good,1
another shirt from van heusen labeled easy care that i bought a,0
while ago came out of the dryer wrinkle free so my washing protocol was fine,0
"over owned 100s of van husen shirts, some wear out at the elbow, over had that a lot,",2
but that's after 2 yrs and few washes,0
"the colors do not bleed,",2
but the material gets very weak of regular office environment wear,0
i'm not making a comparison with shirts taken to the cleaners,0
but other shirts that are on the market,0
sure the ones from bean are more expensive,0
"but they are much better quality, will last twice as long and yes are  actually wrinkle free",0
"very happy with the quality and shape of this shirt,",1
"but fit is a little tighter then normal, so i exchanged for 1/2 size",0
it does not come out of the dryer wrinkle free,2
but i've order a garment steamer to hopefully take the wrinkles out,0
"but at the time of purchase, there was a limited selection of colors and patterns by van heusen on amazon",0
"however, after a few drycleanings",0
"somebody else returned it, obviously someone smarter than i am i am not a big guy",2
but i have a long torso and arms and all i want is shirts that fit,0
doesn't sound that difficult,0
but apparently it's impossible i ordered 5 shirts and one fit properly and it wasn't a van heusen so guess where i'm buying my next five shirts,0
i would return for credit,2
but the policy says in new condition,0
"however, within 6 weeks of purchasing this product, the seams have started to unravel",2
labelled ad xxl,0
but is actually xxxl,0
can't fit around my neck,2
but the shirt is enormous on me,2
"website stated ""no iron"" ,",0
but this is not the case,2
"however, ithis was advertised and described as a flex  collar, and the collar did not stretch nor flex",2
"i did have to iron it before the first wear,",0
"but since then it's been wash, dry, &amp",0
"idk if that's the shirt's fault,",0
but it certainly didn't hurt anything,0
my wife wanted me to return it or take it to the cleaners for pressing,2
but i'm not interested in paying someone to do something that should not be needed,2
my wife agreed to iron the shirt so i hope the wrinkles come out,2
but this is ridiculous,2
"but, it will be a one time wear and then junk it",2
"i particularly like this color,",1
but that_ a personal,0
some of the other colors were priced for a lot more,0
but i won't spend any more for a shirt i wear to work when i can drive to the mall and spend $10 on the clearance rack for dress shirts,0
but there are a few things of note about this shirt:,0
"the wrinkle free shirt definitely needs to be ironed,",2
but i expected that,0
but i ordered the regular classic fit which has plenty of room,0
these two arrived together,0
"but one was not in it_ original packaging, and was a mess",2
i would send it back,2
"but i bought it for an event and i had to wear it, now it is going to goodwill",0
"but as it says the neck stretches or whatever, just know i used to wear a 17 1/2 and needed bigger so i got 18 and with the stretch feature i thought i'd be ok",0
but it still just barely fit,2
however the _lassic pink is more lavender than pink,0
ordered longer arms because i am heavier in my upper back and the length is roomy by 1 inch,0
but i expect shrinkage by 1/2 inch,0
this is advertised as a new product,0
but it had already been unpacked and had a stain where a pin was reinserted,2
body fits ok,1
but could be a little roomier for me,0
"not a lot of stretch,",0
but a little,0
but this is not the same,0
it fits ok,1
"finding a black shirt for semi-casual wear seemed like a real task,",0
but amazon was there once again when the need arose,0
"i wanted to get another one in gray,",1
but they were out last year,0
they did layer with a solid white tee underneath,0
but overall great fit,1
just a tad on the large side,0
but could not find a shirt to fit perfectly,0
however if you want a little more stretch in the collar look elsewhere,0
nice shirt,1
but the fabric is very thin,2
"these address nice shirts,",1
but they still won't cover your big belly,2
"however, it is a scientific breakthrough this company is able to produce a material as thin as this shirt",0
"good quality shirt for an excellent price, could be a bit longer",1
but it was good enough,1
"a little thin on the material must be ironed at all times ,",2
but this does help with keeping cool,0
"it was fine for the money,",1
but it's not awesome,0
but my necks not that big,0
description indicates wrinkle resistant,2
however not sure material reflects description,0
tried the fitted shirts similar to these,0
"but they are too tight, these shirts are not baggy and loose like some styles",2
"not my first choice of brands,",0
but covid weight required me to size up,0
shirt ok,1
but was not as the one it replaced,0
however the reach in this shirt is nowhere close to being correct snd is about a 32 in reach,0
item fit well,1
but don't understand why you're showing it still in delivery,2
little snug on collar,0
but tolerable,0
"my husband_ neck is between a 15 姨?and a 16, and he found the size 15 姨?a bit snug",0
but wearable,0
"it would certainly be fine under a jacket and would do for regular office wear,",1
but i think a touch-up ironing would be in order if the wearer wanted to make an especially good impression,2
"especially if you have a shirt size in mind,",0
but haven_ worn a dress shirt in a few years,2
"no shirt is truly wrinkle free,",2
but this fabric once ironed should stay pretty crisp if you make sure to hang it when you_e done,0
"i thought a stretch neck, or fabric with a little more give would be a great feature for a formal dress shirt,",0
"but i grabbed a handful of fabric and tugged, in both the neck and body of the shirt, there was no give at all",0
"i didn_ find anything particularly stretchy in the collar, it did have some give,",0
but don_ expect it to stretch like women_ leggings,0
"i found the lighter patches along the tops of the shoulders a bit distracting,",0
but the look is plainly evident in the listing pics  check out the pics of the models back,0
"it_ a regular fit,",0
"but for me it fit close to that of a fitted shirt, this one was not at all boxy",0
it is on the thinner side and needed  a t shirt underneath,0
but other than that it_ a nicely made shirt with good quality,1
i don't really notice the stretch collar feature unless i try stretching it by hand -,0
but it certainly doesn't hurt,0
"can be washed and cared for at home,",1
but looks best when professionally cleaned and pressed,0
"the color is nice, totally subjective i know",1
"but i like it, fit and finish are very good",1
but still enough room in the collar,0
i was sceptical about getting the shirts,2
but now i have three we really like them,1
"so, what?_s the problem?  well, when i put it on and with my hands at my side everything is great,",2
"however if i move my arms or do almost anything, the sleeves become 1-3 inches too short and i must return my hands to my sides and pull the sleeves back down",2
"i typically wear brooks brothers non-iron shirts, and",0
"while these aren't the same quality, they are definitely comparable to brands such as calvin klein",1
"this is marketed as a 'regular fit', and",0
while i am certainly a large guy,0
"overall, it's not an awful shirt,",0
"but if you've got access to a costco, the choice for a $20 men's dress shirt is easy, and it's not amazon basics",2
i first got this size shirt in the slim fit,0
"but was a little too tight for me, wanted more maneuverability of my arms",2
but he doesn't mind that his undershirt shows through,0
but if you are a big size man then this is not the shirt for you,0
the label says cotton,0
but i have my doubts,2
"sorry, amazon,",2
but this is bad,2
"thin,",0
but i wear a black undershirt,0
"also it is 100% cotton, fit is a bit snug on chest ,",1
but it may get worse with washing,2
"not to knock my other shirts, because i still love them as well",0
but i am definitely buying these from now on,1
"is a little bigger, not in the way i would like-so a nice, good looking fit is sometimes difficult to achieve,",0
but this shirt manages to make me feel comfortable and make me look nice and fitted,1
i cannot vouch for it's durability over time,1
"but for the price, i will come back to buy another",1
these shirts are very nice,2
but the cut is too snug for me,2
but now the second shirt has also ripped in a similar fashion,2
"being retired i don't wear a dress shirt that often,",1
but when i do  i don't want to have to fight to get dressed,1
don't know how many shirts i have offhand,2
"i was disappointed as i really like the amazon polo t-shirts for warmer months,",2
but i won't be buying any more of these,2
i normally where a 17??,0
but ordered a 17 1/2,0
collee was great,1
but chest and waste was tight,2
fits fine,1
but definitely not breathable nor comforrable to wear,2
i wasn?_t sure at first when i purchased it because it was an amazon branded shirt,0
but it?_s one of my favorites,1
"however, when the shirt was delivered, the color was not the shade that i ordered",2
"this is just my personal taste,",0
"but i wanted to wear this with a suit and tie, and the stripes seemed too bold for me to do that",2
"5"" longer",2
but that is not a major issue,0
"i have lots of higher end, more expensive shirts,",0
but this one is in my weekly rotation during the summer,1
"the first shirt i ordered with 32""-33"" sleeve length,",0
but they were too short,2
but it works nicely for church every week,1
but the rest of the shirt fit him perfectly,1
but i am a chesty female,0
"i am sure there are others with smoother fabric,",0
but not for this price,0
so i bought 3 of the slim fit as i normally fit in them better,1
but the amazon regular fit is actually pretty slim and a better fit for me,1
my husband is very muscular,0
but short so finding him shirts is a struggle,0
"the only complaint was that it was a little tighter on the shoulder/upper chest,",2
but not bad,2
"initially, they fit great,",2
but the shirts shrunk about 2 sizes after washing and drying and no longer fit at all,2
i've worn a 16 1/2 x 34 dress shirt for over 20 years,2
but this shirt did not fit me,2
however the body is more like a slim fit cut and that?_s a problem when you?_re a bigger guy like myself,2
but it is ridiculous,2
"everything about the shirt is very good, the quality of fabric is fine, i would think you needed more thread count",1
but then the price may go up,1
"fabric is not the softest,",1
but i'd pick this shirt over the competitors who offer shirts at 3x the price,1
"product for arm length and neck size fits accordingly,",2
but the shirt doesn't match typical dimensions further down the chest and is extremely tight,2
"the shirt is marked as cotton,",2
but it sure looks like polyester,2
might just be a little below a name brand shirt,1
but i am happy,1
sleeves are longer than i expected,1
"but otherwise the shirt looks great, doesn?_t wrinkle much and is a great value",1
preparing to order more,1
"but, alas, they have been discontinued",1
"similar quality to local retailers,",1
but much less expensive,1
after drying it needed to be ironed,1
but since i won't be wearing it very much it was ok,1
"very nicely made,",2
but too tight in the waist,2
the shits wash well don't need much iron,2
but a bit small the sleeves and the chest,2
"while it was listed as ""regular"" fit, it was closer to ""trim"" fit, it seemed",2
certainly not see through,0
but not thick like oxford cloth,0
"product is not the quality of some higher end brands,",0
but its not priced like them either,0
"as far as wrinkle resistant, not as good as brooks brothers,",1
but not a $135 shirt either,1
not sure on overall durability yet,1
but would buy again,1
my son wore this to work and,1
while the fit was good,1
a little scratchy,0
but good for the price,0
this medium long sleeve shirt fix my 5ft 6in body well,2
but it came little short on the sleeve,2
looked nice,2
but a little tight at stomach,2
the product fit well for the first few weeks,2
but then after the first wash it just fit weird,2
the shirt fit itself is good,2
however after washing it is extremely wrinkly and attracts lint as if it was itself a lint roller,2
"i got a 34/35 sleeve,",2
but if fit like a 35/36,2
it was just what i wanted a well made shirt i just got a size to small i haven't tried on shirts in a long time i've gained weight,1
but it looks good with my dark blue leather blazer,1
but not that much of an issue,2
neck is true to size,2
but not the rest of the shirt,2
"good quality shirt, it does not wrinkle and it repels stains,",0
but fits more like a slim fit as opposed to a regular fit,0
"fits perfectly, length is",0
however long than expected,0
the shirt print was good and quality seemed ok,0
but it definitely is not a traditional regular fit,0
the description stated regular fit,2
but this shirt fit like a slim fitting shirt,2
but very pleased with the shirt,1
but it was not even close,2
the fabric is a bit rough,2
but other than that it is a very good shirt,2
color is good,0
but it?_s tight,0
"good quality,",0
but not the right fit for me,0
great shirt for the price,2
but comes out of dryer more wrinkled than my other dress shirts,2
"the sleeve length is perfect with my arms down,",0
but the sleeves ride up more than those on my other dress shirts when i raise my arms,0
"it's not horrible, mind you,",2
but i prefer a more opaque fabric,2
"you can solve this by occasionally wearing a blue shirt or a yellow shirt, if it matches your suit and socks,",0
but best practice is to wear a gleamingly new white shirt,0
once in a,0
"while i'll wear one of my favorites - a water-colored street scene in paris, or a dark blue tie with light blue colored turtles that i bought in switzerland -",0
but do not wear favorites over and over,0
"to wrap this up, this is a good and useful shirt,",1
but you must adhere to what i have said if you wish to appear well dressed,1
"but 4 stars for now, sorry",0
the colors and pattern is conservative  enough to be warn in a business setting,1
but is equally at home at a relaxed casual outing,1
"money was saved on the shirt fabric as it is a lightweight cotton and suitable,",0
but it isn't a more substantial weave and cotton you would expect to find on a fine shirt,0
so,0
while entirely suitable and attractive it will not replace a high end shirt if that's what you're expecting,0
"seem to fit pretty universally,",2
but for some reason i found this a bit big when he tried it on,2
"this is a regular cut,",2
but still seems a bit big in the chest area,2
"however, a good white shirt is always needed-and because this one seems to run a bit big, my husband can wear it with our without a tie-with for work, without for a more casual, business look",0
"the material is soft without being too sheer,",1
but has enough rigidity to not look sloppy,1
"i've cultivated a bit of a belly over the years, and this fits well through the midsection,",2
"but it's just a touch tight through the shoulders, and it's snug enough on the arms that flexing my bicep makes me feel like the hulkamaniac",2
"it doesn't give enough freedom of movement for the secret service,",0
"but if you're like me and you spend 8 hours sitting in front of a computer, it's not going to be a problem",0
"however, for an occasional dress shirt user who is on a budget, i just don't see how you could go wrong",1
"while yeah, i guess it *could* be used for casual wear",0
"it's 100% cotton, so it takes a light steaming or ironing,",1
but doesn't need a lot,1
"this is a thinner fabric,",1
but not flimsy or super-sheer,1
"you can always pay more for higher quality textiles,",1
but this was ridiculously too small,2
"however, overall it?_s a good shirt",1
"it is not slim fit,",0
but regular fit,0
i don't normally like wearing an undershirt,2
"but with this one, i would recommend it",2
"it is a little slim,",0
but i also gained a little weight,0
the fabric pattern is subtle,1
but nice,1
"however, i think the shirt fits a size too small, or maybe i am a size too big?",2
"it's a little thin in the fabric,",0
but is fine with an undershirt,0
stuff is really nice,0
but the color is too light,0
little on the large side,1
but very comfortable,1
one problem,2
however is that the sleeves are really long and i have fairly long arms,2
great when rolled up,2
but i will need arm braces to wear under a suit,2
i have lots of coloured shorts,1
but this allowed a sensible price short in white wrinkle free well easier to iron,1
good shirt,2
but the delivery service was terrible,2
feels like good quality,1
but not worn yet as using short sleeves,1
"material seems a little flimsy,",0
but not too bad,0
"but for $26 it is not bad, i just expected more",2
"given its low price, i was expecting only a reasonably made product,",1
but the quality of the shirt actually exceeds my expectation,1
this is the regular size that i take,2
but the body on these shirts was a little bit narrower than all my others,2
"very good shirt for the price, sleeve is a bit too long",1
but other than that don?_t hesitate,1
cotton is decent,0
but not great by any means,0
nice shirt and material,0
however it was too small,0
this one was close,0
"but as with most 2xl shirts they seem to increase the ""width/girth"" of the shirt",0
but not the length,0
i've tried 3xl shirts,0
but i could fit 2 of me in those things,0
"but after washing it on the gentle cycle with cold water, dried on low heat and ironed it shrunk down to a ""snug/uncomfortable"" size",2
"it will do for now,",0
the cut and styling is nothing special,0
"but the shirt does not look cheap, it's not a piece of clothing that will attract any attention",0
"the tailoring and needlework seem ok,",0
"but the 'poplin' material is very thin, providing a somewhat translucent look",0
but i guess you get what you pay for,0
looked like they were gone on the ironing board,0
but when i lifted it it they were still there,0
"i can't iron,",2
"but i do have a clothes steamer, which works fine with them",2
"they don't come out crisp,",0
but they are acceptable,0
"however, they are cheap enough that i am able to buy replacements",2
but the feel is horrible,2
"fit is not just right,",2
"but with room to shrink a bit over time,",2
"but, its plastic so it wont shrink",2
"but, people listen and get influenced by brand names, advertising and media",0
"but since he wears them every day, i wanted to get him more",1
"the thing is, the two he bought in the local store - the label said wrinkle free,",2
but they look wrinkled immediately out of the dryer and have to be touched up with an iron,2
"they are the same blue,",0
"but the van heusen shirt's color is fuller, richer, the blue really looks bluer",0
but it is the same color,0
"looked nice,",2
but if they can't provide more accurate information than this i'll avoid this brand in the future,2
it is a different type that doesn't show the thread on the outside,0
but it's there,0
it's good,0
but i had to wash it before i could wear it,0
"while the quality of the shirt is nice, the length of the shirt in the torso is way too short to stay tucked in all day",2
"however, shirt is not true black",0
price is great,0
but a mistake,0
"i will obviously have less dress shirts,",2
but they should last considerably longer,2
"the shirt fits well,",0
but,0
while the sleeves are long enough,0
"it will work for me because i don't need to tuck it in,",1
"but i can't imagine the sides would stay tucked in if i had to wear it that way, nor that they would for a guy",1
"i didn't expect these shirts to be top of the line quality materials based on the price,",1
but they definitely fell below my expectations and this is probably the last time i ever use amazon for any kind of clothing,1
"not only did two of the shirts have some tiny minor stains from the factory,",2
but there are loose ends everywhere,2
"they are great looking, pretty inexpensive shirts,",1
but they are too big,1
"my son will still wear these shirts and he wasn't looking for a fitted or slim cut,",0
but they are baggy,0
"he could definitely fit in a 17"" neck for this shirt,",0
but there were no instructions :,0
"nice shirt, good fit,",1
"but it was way overpackaged -- 16 separate pieces of bag, backers, labels, tags, and pins",1
"not only is this environmentally irresponsible,",2
but it makes the unpacking of the shirt a time consuming hassle,2
but the one we opened fit as a 17,0
"i washed it with 3 sheets of bounce in the dryer, came out not totally wrinkle free",2
but still less crumpled than those that cost $30-40,2
but our store no longer carries this brand,0
"the fabric is not as nice as the ones we've purchased before,",2
but the construction of it is about the worst i've seen,2
"if you get a good one they are great,",2
but be prepared to make returns,2
"i was skeptical after reading other reviews,",1
but the quality seems good,1
"my husband is just under 6'1"", and thin",0
"but athletic build, at about 185 lbs",0
he's a manager,0
but is often running around and active all day at work,0
"fyi if you order the 3 pack, they're not only packaged separately,",0
but they shipped separately as well,0
they fit as expected,0
"but they are a little short on length,",0
but not so much that they come up out of your pants,0
"the shirt feels very good and i love that it has a packet,",1
but it's to lose,1
"the chest too baggy, so knowing that, i should have ordered the slim fit for him,",2
but  he tied his tie with a double windsor and that took care of the,2
"my wife recommended that i get fitted at men's warehouse,",1
but i wanted to make a quick and easy purchase,1
"the only slight knock on these shirts is that they feel a just a tad thin,",0
"however they are still solid and well constructed, and their lightweight fabric is appreciated in that they don???feel heavy or suffocating",0
"i wanted a textured fabric with same color striping in pale blue,",1
but there must be an amazon ban on those of any brand,1
the new one looks similar,0
but is not to size,0
5 collar,0
it measures 16,0
but the label says 16,0
i???rather be able to use my metal ones,0
"but for this price, i??_ happily deal with it",0
"looks nice, washed well, lays nicely when worn, ordered17"" neck for elderly dad whose always worn 16-16 1/2",1
i have a fat neck and short arms,0
but not an overly protruding belly and i???not tall so i needed a shirt that would fit without being blousy or having really really long tails,0
"normally, i wear 15 1/2"" shirts,",0
"but recently i've found that 16s"" are more comfortable",0
"overall,",1
"however, the shirt is well made and comfortable",1
i can't say for certain,0
"but we assumed it was blood from whoever packaged the shirt, accidentally pricking themselves from placing all those pins",0
unfortunately i was in a position where i couldn't return or exchange the shirt,2
"but wanted to advise others, check the shirt thoroughly before wearing",2
i was particularly pleased with the  comfort,1
while seated,1
the fabric feels a bit lighter than other shirts i have,0
but it is an excellent buy for the money,0
"the overall fit is baggier that expected,",0
"but comparing it to $50-100 shirts, it's not fair to complain",0
"quality is not the best,",0
"but, not the worse either",0
"i thought i was getting a deep red,",0
but it's more like a clay or dark taracotta orange,0
"they claim to be wrinkle free,",2
"but after washing and drying and immediately removing from the dryer, i still had a little ironing to do",2
"shirt fits fine,",1
but packaging really leaves something to be desired,1
"i???send it back,",0
but it???already in my home,0
"not incredibly comfortable as more expensive options are,",2
but for the price i expected as much,2
i hope the collar retains it's point,2
"but if the collar stays get worn out from washing, i could see it deforming",2
"but the quality of this shirt was good, as expected from van h if you??_ work any of their shirts",1
next was a little tighter than my usual shirts,0
but i lived,0
washed and dried and was virtually wrinkle free,0
but if you want that crisp look your gonna have to iron it,0
i received a request for a promotion,0
while wearing this shirt,0
"but i'm 6'2"" and often order ""tall"" versions of shirts",0
too bad,2
but they're nice shirts all the same,2
"fabric is not as thick as i expected/hoped,",0
but fit to size,0
"great for daily wear,",0
"but will get a better brand at men's warehouse for fancier events, and pay about 100 bucks per shirt i know",0
"it seemed too stiff a fabric at first,",2
"but softened nicely when washed, quality is fine",2
"tight on his neck,",0
but all shirts are,0
i haven't washed it,0
but i'm praying it will come out well,0
the only redeemable quality was that the collar fit,2
but everything else was so so disappointing,2
"the shirt looks nice out of the box and the color is great,",0
but that's where the praise ends,0
"this is clearly a case of a company trying to save money,",2
but the customer pays the price,2
"when ordering clothes online you cannot try them on,",2
"but once you have ordered them once and find that they fit, it is more convenient to re-order clothes online that you know fit each time you need replacements",2
a they all claim to be poplin,2
but they have varying degrees of thickness and texture so either they aren't all poplin or the quality control varies,2
they've all performed marvelously for me,0
however so no issues,0
"however, they are cut for much larger chest sizes than in the past",0
"i bought the exact same shirt in purple and green,",2
but the purple seemed to be alot softer with better fabric and the black fabric seems a bit thinner in layers and definitely not as soft,2
and sadly the wrist fits great,2
but the arms seem a bit off and to big to be perportionate,2
however the state of the packaging of the shirt was atrocious,0
"anyways, besides the extensive wrinkling the shirt was not damaged, and its nothing a wash and ironing can't sort out,",2
but it definitely left a sour impression,2
"this is being used as part of a costume, so the shortcomings can be overlooked,",0
"but otherwise, i would have sent it back",0
but now you know,0
i'm a pretty big guy and hit the gym pretty regularly,2
"but holy moly, they are huge",2
i guess if you had 24 inch biceps you might a need a shirt like this,0
but for the normal human being they are way too big,0
but wrinkle resistant is a relative term,0
"i thought that by purchasing a van heusen shirt i could make sure that i would get a certain standard,",0
but just realized the brand does not guaranty same fit or quality across products,0
"shirt is nice quality,",1
"the neck and the rest of the shirt fit ok,",2
"i was hoping to buy more,",1
but i will try another brand to see if they fit better,1
i had the proper neck size and sleeve length,1
i bought it for a job interview,2
but it looks terrible,2
"but, the base of neck to shirt tail pattern is the same as a 15-32/33?",0
it was a bit tight in the neck,2
but he also has a larger neck so i'd say it would fit an average neck,2
"but, when it came out of the dryer it was ready to wear",0
this definitely is not permanent press regardless if you take it out of the dryer,0
while still damp and hang to finish drying or immediately take it out of dryer when completely dry,0
"i wish that i had returned them,",1
but was so disappointed by the quality i wanted nothing to do with the seller again,1
"i really enjoy this shirt,",1
but the collar is way to tight,1
"5 bigger and that did nothing,",0
but other than that the shirt was amazing,0
the shirt fits well,0
"but i could use a lil more space around the shoulders, chest and midsection",0
"it fits, almost just right,",0
but could be looser for my taste,0
but the waist is way too large,2
"but it never occurred to me that a ""regular fit would be so large",0
"it shrinks a little when you put it through a warm cycle in the washing machine,",0
but not a lot,0
"it's a standard shirt that isn't going to make you look excellent,",0
but it's cheap,0
but that might be my incredible personality and social skills rather than the shirt,0
"the product arrived on time, it was easy to get creases in the collar and sleeves",1
"while ironing, and it's a great looking and fitting shirt",1
"the neck size on this shirt was a good fit,",0
however the rest of the shirt was much larger than what we were expecting,0
the shirt said it was a medium,0
but fit like a large,0
"however, i always wear and under shirt so it isn???a big deal for me",0
"it's not exactly tailored,",2
but the cuff reaches past the suit sleeve,2
"it's thin fabric,",0
"but not too thin, just ordinary for a dress shirt",0
"the white is slightly see thru,",2
but otherwise its a loose fit regular shirt washes well and keeps up the shape,2
so like i said not sure if i would wear this to an event or black tie party,2
but for everyday usage its perfect,2
"it may shrink after washing,",2
"but for this series of concerts i did, it was perfect",2
but shirt fits perfectly,2
the collar fits perfectly,0
but the body of the shirt is so huge it makes him look like a brick house,0
but for the neck i absolutely adore the shirt,0
great shirt that was affordable,0
but quality,0
perfect for a server not too expensive,2
but still doesn???look cheap and it doesn???wrinkle often,2
it didn???look awkward,0
but the feeling was that it was on the tighter side,0
however i'm very impressed with the fit and quality of the shirt,1
i purchased this a,0
"while back and completely forgot about it for close to 8 months,",0
"i generally don't buy close on amazon,",2
but i have a few of the shirts already and they arrived in good shape and fit perfectly,2
"it does seem to get linty pretty easily,",0
but that's expected,0
the material isn't summer-shirt-thin,0
but is more the weight of a good dress shirt that you wear around the office,0
"i know you get some wrinkles after washing,",2
but not like this this,2
"as i get older, my neck gets thicker,",0
"but my arms stay at 32""",0
"not wrinkle free, may qualify as resistant",2
but nowhere near the wrinkle free shirts i have,2
"but if you order a well known brand name it goes well, though costs more than many deals on unknown brands",0
"i don't like loud goddy colored shirts for work,",0
but i do like to have an alternative to grey/white/black work shirts,0
i would have tried to discuss with a company rep before posting,0
but seller was not listed,0
this is a good shirt for the price it's not wrinkle free so it might require a little ironing if you wear it with a suit or dress jacket you can get by without ironing it the key is don't wear it to often since i have a variety of shirts i might go months in between wearing it,1
but you can't beat the price,1
we use to have a van heusen store near us,0
but unfortunately it closed down,0
however the fabric is a bit thin so you can sit his undershirt through it,2
"a little long in length,",0
but my husband is 5????ish so could just be a height issue,0
decent quality and decent color so far,2
but certainly not wrinkle free,2
i was trying to avoid going to the store with kids,0
but this was one time amazon failed me,0
"unfortunately, i wasn't 100% sure of the size and guessed at it",2
but it was too large,2
"i haven???had to dress up since forever,",0
but needed a white shirt for a funeral service,0
it's a good,1
but for the price,1
"however, i didn't expect how tight the shirt fit me, less money means less material i guess",2
"it also wasn???sized as advertised,",0
"but was an xs, not a 14",0
the shirt arrived and had those numbers,0
but also had xxl on tag too and it ended up being huge,0
i actually ordered it for myself to wear under sweaters because i like with a collar and sleeves show,0
but it was a stiff as a board so i had to return it,0
color and fit were great,1
"but man is ""wrinkle free"" a lie",1
i mean for example i just pulled 7 shirts out of the laundry and most of them make no claims of being wrinkle-free,0
but this one does and is the second most wrinkled shirt of the bunch,0
"so what idiot decided to send new shirts into the market smelling like tide? after a few washings it is out,",0
but not good,0
"they're light enough so that i can stand outside my bar in the summer and not sweat myself to death,",0
but heavy enough to keep me warm during the winter with a suit jacket and an overcoat,0
"its baggy,",2
but the worst part is the sleeve length,2
the van heusen fitted poplin dress shirt fits comfortably around my arms and torso and does not restrict any of my movements,1
while wearing,1
this shirt claims to be 36/37,0
"but, as my pictures demonstrate, the sleeves are nowhere near that",0
you would think they would stop placing stickers on the fabric so they dont damage the product,2
but nahh,2
"now i know that most companies do this,",0
but come on,0
"while not expensive, you can do a lot better just getting a fancy brand on sale at a department store",0
but my shirts were destroyed due to an unfortunate accident,0
but it must have actually been a 17,0
"a solid, low cost shirt for someone who is not trying to look like a billionaire or wall street mogul,",0
but needs a shirt that doesn't seem cheap to those around them,0
"i'm perplexed, this is all the brand ive ever bought for him for dress shirts and its never failed me up til now for sizing, or its not really fitted,",2
but was albelled as such,2
i haven't had an issue buying this brand from amazon before,1
but for some reason not only was the material a little extra thin on this shirt,1
but the sleeves run small,1
but i do now,0
i don't get it,0
but thank goodness for amazon returns,0
we would have returned it,2
but he wouldn't have had a shirt for his costume so we kept it anyway,2
"but as i stated, the body is not a fitted look -- lots of extra material",2
i normal,0
"but a 16, 34-35 shirt regular and deal with all the extra fabric around the middle",0
"my only complaint, would be the inseam length isn't very long,",2
"but maybe that would be solved by a ""tall"" fitted shirt",2
"while i certainly do not workout, i do have a v-shape torso that makes it difficult to find reasonably priced shirted that have the tapered look that i desire",0
my only real complaint is that it does still wrinkle a tiny bit which isn???a huge deal and the size i got fits good in some places,2
but it???too large and others,2
"would 100% recommend these for guys who want to consistently show up to work looking nice,",1
but don't want to spend hours ironing or money on dry cleaning,1
"it was a good, comfortable feel,",0
"but not exactly ""fitted"" which is perhaps a tall order for men's shirt sizing",0
"length of sleeves and color size is great,",0
but extra fabric in armpits and last,0
"i understand it's fitted,",0
but this is way fitted for my frame,0
yeah i'm chubby,0
but will probably come off soon,0
this shirt looks nice,0
but has a few flaws:,0
"but after wear and wash cycles, it is soft and wrinkle-free as long as i pull it from the dryer immediately when finished",0
the sleeves are fine,0
but the body of the shirt is huge,0
im not use to buy clothes from internet because of sizes,0
but thanks fully the shirt is true to size and fited perfect for me and i selected the fitted one because im skinny and normally all my shirts fits me like a potato bag ???in both sides,0
but man this shirt is perfect in every aspect specially if your skinny and for $15 bucks is a great deal 100% recommended,0
"however, that being said, it's a decent looking shirt and fits fine in all other aspects",0
but don't ignore the sleeve issue,0
i have a neck on the smaller side,0
but broad shoulders,0
"the quality is pretty good,",0
but it is not fantastic,0
"disclaimer: i have never ordered a dress shirt online before,",0
"but i know my measurements, so i gave it a go",0
"i am giving this a 3 star review becaue the sleeves on the shirt i received were too long, they say 32/33",0
"but fit much more like a 34/35, perhaps bigger than that",0
i know i am beyond the return period,0
but perhaps you can make an exception for my account which buys many things from you and does not return much,0
the shirt is fine,0
but it took to long to get here,0
"however, if you say something is going to be there by friday, it should be there by friday not two weeks later",2
i was disappointed,0
but for the price i won't complain,0
"regarding the material, it is slightly see through on the white shirts i bought,",0
"but, as another reviewer mentioned, that is what you get with this fabric",0
"quality of the shirt is fine,",0
but the sizing is inaccurate,0
5??32/33 and,1
"while it not a perfect fit, it???as close as one would hope",1
"however, if you get one that was rolled up in a ball and thrown into a plastic bag then they aren't so nice",2
"close enough to be wrinkle free,",0
but was more pleased with the fit,0
"i tried several times and even got the shirt wet again,",0
but it comes out more wrinkled,0
it fits me perfectly in the trunk,0
but the neck is too tight,0
but the shirt would drape me like a tent,0
"fitted shirts are perfect for the athletic physique,",0
however they typically carry a higher price tag,0
"i have purchased van heusen shirts from jc penny, so i know the quality and fit are perfect,",1
however the price here on amazon is greater than half off in a retail establishment,1
"i wouldn't wear it to an important function,",0
"but for a normal day at the office, it's perfectly fine",0
"the fabric quality is a good value for the price,",0
but it's a bit coarse and thin compared to other shirts you can buy,0
"if you can afford it, my suggestion is owning one or more of these for standard use,",0
but also owning one really good shirt for your most important occasions,0
nothing fancy,0
but good quality,0
"however, years ago van heusen's ""gold"" label of fitted shirts fit even better and was a slightly higher quality material",1
"shirt was quite large through the chest,",0
but absolutely billowing in the trunk,0
but i was blown away with this dress shirt,0
"the shirt i received was branded and packaged under a van heusen label,",0
but the quality of this product was definitely not what i'm used to from this brand,0
"gets two stars instead of one because technically, it can be worn if you take a pair of scissors and trim all the stray threads,",0
but one shouldn't have to do that,0
"i thought this ""fitted"" shirt was the same as ""slim fit"",",0
but it has a standard baggy chest and sleeves with a waist a little bigger than the slim fit,0
"i guess it's designed for bodybuilders with huge chests and arms, and no beer belly,",0
but it looks ridiculous on most people,0
the price is right,0
but the fit is all wrong,0
it comes with stays in the collar,0
"but no slot, so you can't insert your own",0
but there was no slot to insert one to make it less flimsy,0
"these are very nice shirts,",0
but i feel that they require ironing so i only gave 4 stars,0
the fitted shirt is just slightly tapered at mid section,0
but not tight,0
"for all of us with 18-inch necks, 32/33-inch sleeves, and the need for a fitted shirt, such shirt was all",0
but impossible to find at local stores,0
"in terms of quality, no they aren't going to last through daily use,",0
but for the price you cannot go wrong,0
nothing serious,0
but important to mention,0
longer than expected,0
but not a deal breaker as it???easy to tuck in,0
"i suppose if you took them out of the dryer right away you wouldn't even need to iron them,",0
but i can't seem to get the timing right,0
"for my 6' tall adult son who has broad/built shoulders and long arms,",0
but is very slim in the waist,0
"the item description sounded perfect for his body shape,",0
but the shirt was too large in the torso area and sleeves,0
"the neck and sleeve length were the right size,",0
but it was too big &amp,0
"we were hoping for a slim fit,",0
but unfortunately it's not,0
for me,2
"however, i won't buy them again",2
"not very wrinkle resistant at all and the ""fitted"" size is much to big if you want a more snug fit",0
but not tight,0
i have bought other shirts from them and i feel like they will sometimes get worn at the collar or at the end of the sleeves,0
but that hasn't happened yet with this one,0
the neck and sleeve lengths were fine,0
"but the cut was not a ""fitted"" cut",0
"the material quality is good, soft",0
but definitely not wrinkle-free,0
"material is a little scratchy compared to higher end shirts,",0
but not too bad,0
"i like that it is not skinny like a slim fit,",0
but has a nice fitted appearance,0
"i????always been happy with van heusen shirts,",0
"but this one is not a ??獄?_id??white, as it???advertised",0
"but since these are a poly/cotton blend, they really do resist wrinkles very well",0
"perhaps a bit thin,",0
but not a problem for me because i always wear an undershirt,0
however i work in a tech field that often takes me onto job sites and other places that can be hard on clothes,0
however that may be a concern if you wear this without any undershirt,0
good shirt,0
but would have preferred slim fit i guess,0
i am 16 1/2 and a lot of times shirts claim to be that size,0
but are not,0
yep fits,0
but is a very tight fit around the waist,0
"looks surprisingly good,",0
"but i wish it were just a little longer, because after a few high reaches and a couple of bends, i had trouble keeping it tucked in",0
"i would have given it 5 stars,",0
"but it's not the softest material, and i found it a little bit prickly",0
"the pocket yielded pretty quickly to my aggressive pen use and needed to be resown,",0
but otherwise good,0
not horribly so,2
but still a lil baggy,2
"has a pretty cheap feel to it,",0
but then again it's an inexpensive shirt,0
no men???dress shirt is ??驪__nkle-free??,0
but this shirt works well,0
its actually pretty interesting,0
but will offset photos,0
"material is lighter weight and thinner,",0
"but with a proper undershirt, it???fine for most indoor settings",0
but it should have been repacked with more care before being sent out again,0
"i don't have 'thick' wrists by any standard,",0
but the cuff was tight from the beginning and after just a few wears the sleeve began to tear out,0
the final product is okay,0
but the job screening could clearly be much better,0
"material is not van husen's softer poplin,",0
but still pretty nice,0
but it seems shorter than even their normal shirts,2
"not as wrinkle free as i would have liked, still have to iron them",0
but it???not as bad,0
"i haven't washed the shirt yet so i can't comment on color durabiity etc,",2
but if there is anything i'll update this review,2
i like the fit of these shirts,0
but it's unwearable because of a weird blue stain and some brown stains,0
"wish the photos would more closely represent what you get,",0
"but maybe it is subjective? even with that though, i can't give this more than one star",0
but then i'm not in as good of shape as i once was,0
"they're acceptable,",0
but i have other dress shirts,0
"the shirt was ""fitted""",0
but still had a significant amount of excess fabric hanging out the sides of the trousers,0
"fitted poplin style fixed that problem for me,",0
while still leaving the slim fit waist contour,0
the shirt is of good quality,0
but was way bigger than i anticipated,0
great quality shirt,0
but definitely not a ???_?ted fit??,0
i???6?? and 205 pounds have long arms so i thought the 36/37 sleeve would also dictate the athletic taper,0
but it???way too baggy around the waist and is hard to tuck in all the extra material,0
i still wear the shirt for work,0
but doing any kind of movement has an unneeded strain,0
i bought the same exact shirt years ago and it was the correct length,0
but this is definitely faulty,0
"i ordered a size that fits my neck comfortably,",0
but not snug,0
with a 17 inch neck you kind of expect proportional sizing,0
"but not only is this short it is too small to go around, i'm big",0
but not abnormally,0
they say fitted,0
but they were not as fitted as we had expected them to be,0
we bought them based on the size we had previously bought in store,0
but these do not fit like the first set,0
"these are not fitted as is advertised,",0
but look like any other regular shirt,0
but he had planned to wear a vest over it,0
"unfortunately, the wedding was postponed due to covid19,",0
but the shirt was great,0
but a big belly,0
"my wife's only complaint is that it is not easy to iron--yes, i know it says ""no iron"",",0
but she is a perfectionist and irons all my dress shirts,0
"it???a nice quality shirt,",0
"but for a shirt that is for a person with long arms, it was definitely not for a taller person as it barely tucked into my pants",0
probably good for guys so they don't have to iron,0
but i kind of wanted it to be more relaxed,0
but this will do for now,1
the price tag that they came with said $45,0
but i bought each shirt for $20,0
the sleeves seem a little short,0
but other than that it fits perfect,0
this shirt was advertised as fitted,0
but fits very loosely,0
the neck and sleeve length were correct,0
but it was extremely baggy everywhere else,0
he really loves the slimmer fit in the waist,0
but he is also muscular so keep that in mind when ordering this size if the recipient has a larger waist,0
"but it is definitely worth the money, and with a bit of tailoring will be a fine addition to my shirts",0
"it's what's expected as a cheaper dress shirt,",0
"but if you can't nafford nicer ones, then this is your best option",0
i wasn't sure whether my son needed a fitted shirt,0
but he didn't like the way his regular dress shirts blouson out,0
"also the grey color is stunning, not shiny",0
but lustrous,0
i was expecting this to be a one use item,0
but will definitely wear it again,0
"ultimately i got ""extreme/extra slim fit"" shirts, which are better",0
but still a tiny bit loose in some areas,0
but you need to clean up every time when you wear it,0
more expensive,0
but better quality,0
but it's at the cleaners,0
"these shirts say ""wrinkle free' all over them",0
"it says slim fit,",0
but the sleeves are about double the size of a proper slim fit dress shirt,0
the quality of the shirt was very good,0
but i ordered a shirt with too large a collar,0
"great for the price,",0
fabric is nice and all,0
but it doesn't fit,0
i haven???worn it out yet,0
but it appears to be of decent quality,0
"i've only washed and worn it once,",0
"but it seems well constructed, and it fit just like i wanted it to",0
"it fits very good though, and the quality is very nice,",0
but it is just a tad bit puffier than i would like,0
"the pocket seems to be lower on the chest than average,",0
but that???not a dealbreaker,0
they 'are' alittle greyish black and not super black,0
but these shirts last forever practically and fit me well,0
"getting the size thats right for you is pretty critical on this shirt though,",0
but once you know it youre golden,0
and the shirt fits well,0
"however as i am not as ""slim"" as i used to be the tapered style do not work for me",0
if we're lucky we find it a bit cheaper at ross,0
but it takes a lot of trips and looking to get lucky and this beats waiting in line,0
"i wasn't sure if it was going to be ""fitted""",0
but it is,0
now why in the world are all those pins necessary? seperate issue,0
but worth mentioning,0
yes the presentation is nice,0
but enough already,0
"the sleeves could accommodate the massive arms of a body builder,",0
but they were too long on mine,0
however it showed up in the plastic packaging and had obviously already been opened,0
the tags that go with the shirt were in there,0
but they were no longer attached to the shirt,0
obviously this had been opened and returned,0
but i was trying to give this as a gift,0
but it's perfect,0
"it was reasonably priced,",0
"however, now that i found this shirt and know how it will fit",0
"it does, indeed, requiring little ironing,",0
but the polyester blend does not make for high quality material,0
fits well at the neck,0
but the sides seem larger than they should be for a fitted shirt,0
he is tall and skinny,0
"but has never worn a ""fitted"" shirt",0
"really beautiful shirt,",0
"but make no mistake about it, it's hot pink -- which was fine because my husband liked it anyway, and i liked it better than the color it shows on the site, so win-win",0
"perfect for those who do not like the baggy shirt look,",0
but don't want the slim contoured look either,0
the material isn't the best,0
but you get what you pay for,0
"but if you need a good, inexpensive shirt this will do",0
but so far amazon has the best price,0
it is tight enough around the chest and waist,1
while still being appropriate for work,1
"it is true that it isn't as blue as in the picture and more of a dark teal-ish color,",0
but it is still really nice shade and not too vibrant,0
"0"", 190 pounds, i have a a big chest and big arms and this fits me like a slim shirt,",0
"but better because is loose in other places, the material feel good, i will update after washing it",0
"the neck and sleeve length were fine,",0
"but the length of both shirts were for someone in the 5'10"" height range",0
it took me a,0
while to take it off,0
"i sweat in the arm pits, and this fabric does nothing",0
but make that fact very apparent,0
"love van heusen shirts,",0
but the sizing was off on this one,0
"form-fitting and flashy,",0
"however, not very wrinkle-free",0
"the shoulders fit perfectly,",0
but i have about 10??extra around the waist,0
"i tried paying less for other shirts on-line that claimed to be high quality,",0
but you definitely get what you paid for,0
"nice shirt,",0
"but mine was a ""seconds"" shirt",0
but buyer beware these may be seconds,0
my bf usually wears a 2x,2
but this shirt runs very small,2
he???115 pounds and 5??5?? fit is a little big on him,0
but that???fine,0
"i wish it were a bit less wrinkled coming out of the dryer,",0
but since he invariably pairs his shirts with pullover sweaters it's not really an issue,0
"nice dress shirt,",0
but i still don???get the job,0
"not too thick to make you hot all the time,",0
but not too thin so that you can see the undershirt,0
but it should not have arrived in that condition,0
too small - ordered and it says 18 1/2,2
but way too small for me,2
just as nice,0
but doesn't have a pocket,0
"nice shirt quality wise,",0
but it runs small,0
"sorry,",0
"but it shouldn't be listed as ""big and tall""",0
"i'm not that big,",0
but this shirt is for a skinny guy,0
"tag says fitted cut,",0
but it is baggy on the sides,0
"this shirt,",0
"while described as ""big and tall"" was tight on the arms, across the chest, and in the waist",0
the shirt does taper,0
but not enough to make it tight on the belly that i do have,0
"it is a slim fit, so expect it to be a little tighter than a normal sized shirt,",0
but it's perfect for tall skinny guys like myself,0
"but i've worn/washed the shirt only 4 times, and that's the state it's in now",0
"but on this one the collar is a bit too wide, and",0
"fits well,",0
but for a xxl with extra long arms,0
i need to wear a white shirt every day at work,0
"but i don't want expensive shirts because my shirts always, inevitably, get ruined somehow",0
"however, given how inexpensive it is, i will definitely buy more if them",0
not as fitted as it could be around the chest and waist,0
but it's definitely better than a regular fit,0
"nice shirt, neck size is good,",0
but for a slim fit it's a bit closer to a normal-sized shirt than i would have expected,0
"material is a little thin for heavy starching,",0
but the cuffs and collar will hold starch okay,0
"but has shoulders that are a tiny bit too large, even though i have slightly larger than average shoulders--a little surprising on a fitted cut",0
"it's hard to find a perfect shirt that's the right size, so",2
while the fit isn't perfect,2
the color wasn't what i expected,0
but the fit was perfect so ran with it,0
it softens after 10 washes,0
but that causes extra wrinkles,0
"i like it softer,",0
but then its harder to keep out those wrinkles,0
"as others mentioned, a bit see-through,",0
but not a problem if worn with a white undershirt,0
"the quality is basic, not fancy material,",0
but the shirt serves its purpose,0
"i'm not nearly as satisfied with these as i was with my previous van heusen shirts,",0
but they work well enough to get by,0
"i purchased this shirt because it's advertised as ""wrinkle free"",",0
but it certainly isn't,0
"however these two shirts, especially the french blue one, come out of the dryer wrinkled enough i can't wear them to work",2
"while i don't feel oddly shaped, i guess i am",0
but i'm only 5'10,0
"this has no frills, no flare, no nothing in the way of decoration -",0
but it fits well and has held up well to repeated washings in spite of the thinness of the fabric,0
the length of the shirt could be a tad longer,0
but it works,0
not a fancy shirt,0
but pretty decent dress shirt,0
"everything fits great about this shirt,",0
but it's just a bit too short from shoulder to shoulder,0
"it's not bad enough to be noticeable,",0
but it's a little more snug than comfortable,0
"i don't mind, really because it gives me variation in my wardrobe,",0
but the same cut by arrow allows room for my shoulders,0
"fabric seems to be of decent quality and collar's good,",0
"but arms are about 2"" shorter than other brands",0
"shirt's supposed to be ""fitted,""",0
but it's billowy even on a slightly overweight frame,0
"i have many of these and they're good,",0
"but there is something wrong with the ""grey stone"" color",0
but what i did like was that the armpit area didn't sag like a lot of these shirts,0
"overall i would have kept it if i absolutely needed it,",0
but i don't so i am not,0
wrinkles easy,0
but fits as described,0
not fancy,0
but classic and functional,0
very nice shirt,0
but way too small,0
"i bought 2 shirts, both same size, same brand, one fits,",0
but this one was skin tight,0
i'm super thin and tall so even athletic fit is a little loose on me,0
"but it's got nice long sleeves, a nice high collar and the black is very slick and a little shiny",0
"really nice for the price,",0
but after only two trips to the dry cleaners and the threading on the breast pocket and both sleeves are starting to fray,0
"these shirts are ok,",0
"but not nearly as slim fitting as i expected, and the material is thinner than i expected it to be",0
there were creases when we first opened it,0
but nothing an iron didn???fix,0
"i can say they fit perfect and i liked the colors,",0
"but like i said, they are not wrinkle free, the care instructions label that is sewed in to the shirt says to steam iron",0
not only did the sleeves fit,0
but the shirt did too,0
"for a muscular man, it fits nicely as the neck and shoulders can be ordered large",0
"but the waist is tapered so not overly large, although i wish it were tapered just a big more",0
"cotton blend with polyester, which is normally fine,",0
but this shirt after three washes is still like steel wool on the skin,0
the sleeves and neck fit correctly,0
but this is supposed to be a tall shirt and the shirt is not long enough,0
"fits as good as i can guess from an online purchase, little snug",0
but with a few wears it feels more comfortable,0
not a luxury shirt -,2
"but at the price, the pain is much less when you get an ink/toner stain or rip your shirt on an office copier",2
"supposed to be a slim fit,",0
but it didn't come anywhere close,2
the quality seemed decent,1
but i didn't wear the shirt due to the fit,2
"not the best material, and the fit is large around the stomach",2
but i suppose that's better for most people,0
if you can get it cheap do it,0
but i would never pay more than 25 dollars for this shirt,2
don't expect wrinkle free,0
but it's not as bad as 100% cotton,0
i thought this shirt was the same as one's i already owned,0
but the shirt i got certainly isn't fitted,2
"the fabric is a little less than perfect,",1
but that's a product of the price,1
"this is truly a well made shirt, could be a little more fit,",1
but one of the best shirts i have ever purchased,1
"the sleeve length is perfect and collar fits well,",1
but i am a tall guy with a long body so the shirt barely goes into my pants,2
"unfortunately i probably need to only buy tall shirts, which are much more expensive,",0
but i would have thought with the long sleeves that the entire shirt length would be proportional,0
decent cheap work shirt,1
but poor material quality,2
"he's a large in the shoulders,",0
but regular shirts are always baggy around the midsection,0
"he often has to buy xl just so it's long enough,",0
but then it's too big everywhere else,0
"the rest of the shirt is baggy,",2
but i expected that,0
the neck size was good and the fabric quality was fine,1
but the sleeves and body of this shirt was huge compared to other 17,2
"this shirt has way less material in the waist than the non-fitted,",2
but i'm a bit irritated that it doesn't have less,2
"it is a bit tight,",2
but wearable,0
"it's not as soft a material as i expected after its first wash,",2
but we'll see what happens after a couple more washes,0
but not super thin either,0
my husband needs a large neck,0
but a slimmer body,0
a little on the large side,0
but neck fit was good,1
poplin is soft and washes well,1
but does need a touch up ironing,0
my bad,0
but the arm length is just perfect,1
i prefer the traditional/regular fit better,2
but so far i have not bought any shirt that last as long and resists wrinkles as well as this shirt,1
"i hate digging through local department stores, having to ask the store where to find this or that,",0
but i usually put up with it because i need to try it on to see if shirts fit,0
"not basically a normal shirt,",0
but just a little slimmer starting under the arm pits and going down to the waste,2
"it is hard to find colors i like in the stores,",0
"however,",0
i??턤 got a large neck,0
but shorter arms,0
"but shirt fit perfectly, specially around my neck",1
"but even though it's ""athletic fit,"" it's still huge below my chest",2
but good shirts for the price,1
but better than some other shirts,1
but it always looks better with some starch,2
"the body and sleeves are right on, just wish the shirt tail was longer,",0
but it works,0
"it's always a gamble to buy clothes online,",0
but this shirt looks sharp and fits well,1
the collar is a little bigger than what i usually have,2
but nothing out of the ordinary especially if you wear a tie,0
the stitching seems good,1
but is on the cheap side,0
"i was looking for something to fit a bit tighter, and this is pretty loose,",2
but still a really nice shirt,1
"not as nice of a cut as more expensive shirts, and as a consequence i have a hard time keeping it tucked in,",2
but overall it's a good shirt,1
i'm not sure what i expected for this amount of money,2
but this is a terrible shirt,2
"yeah, they're small holes,",0
but when there's so many of them and they're all in obvious places,2
5 inch neck so i couldn't wear it,0
however not their fault and the shirt fit perfect otherwise and was super comfortable,1
the fabric is a bit thin,2
but in the summertime that's a good thing,0
"the collar stays are sewn in, as other reviewers have said,",0
but i don't really mind,0
but i would definitely buy again,1
nice fit in the shoulders,1
while it hugs the waist,1
great all around white dress shirt for the price,1
but definitely runs somewhat large and baggy,2
the neck size was true to size,1
but the overall width of the shirt and length was definitely a little larger then true to size,2
apparently i have a large neck compared to the rest of my body -,0
"while somewhat more fitted than a regular-cut shirt, this is still fairly baggy around the middle",0
"sleeves, neck and chest fit is perfect,",1
"but it flaps around a 32"" waist",2
i guess i don???know what ??꼒tted??means,2
"but since it was called out by a sticker on the shirt, i assume it???a thing",0
but the wrinkles will not come out no matter how much you iron,2
"i didn't have high expectations, since it's a cheap oxford,",2
but i was hoping for a little more for my money,2
"it kinda falls into that weird length of a little longer than i like a shirt meant to be untucked,",2
"but a little too short to be tucked in without coming out,",2
but not a huge deal,0
"not a little bit,",2
but completely,2
"i have a middling complexion, not super dark,",0
but i have a little color,0
"i know i can't ask a lot of a shirt this cheap, and i'm used to a little color showing through a white shirt, especially when it's tight against the skin,",0
but this shirt was closer to a frosted plastic shower curtain than actual white fabric,2
seems like nice quality,1
but the length is too short,2
you'd think a 36/37 sleeve length would mean longer in the body,2
but it doesn't,2
"however, this shirt came with a hole in it",2
not to fitted,2
but nice quality shirt,1
"little long in the sleeves and a touch big in the shoulders,",2
however that's pretty typical for most off-the-rack shirts i buy,0
"beware it is cotton so if youre using suit doesnt feel so hot,",0
but equally wrinkles more,0
"5,",0
but then i saw there was a 7,0
but i was not about to promote adding shipping charges to what is listed generically as prime without a clearer explanation,2
"the material seems to be getting thinner,",2
"but still adequate, especially with a white t-shirt underneath",0
"it has an odd smell on delivery,",2
but it goes away after a wash,0
it???not necessary,0
it doesn't have that expensive look,0
but good enough for going to work,1
i have expected a little more fitted,2
but is ok,0
"should've taken a picture as proof,",0
but here it goes,0
i like the shirt,1
but when i think ??꼒tted?? i???thinking that there won???be a lot of extra material around the waist or arms,2
"the size is a bit large since they only had 1 size above mine,",0
"but with a nice coat or a nice suit, it shouldn't be a problem",1
it was advertised as fitted,2
but does not wear like one,2
"however, i am kinda short at 5'6"" so this might fit better for a taller/more built fellow, no frays or wear, the color is vibrant",0
i just wish they came in a shorter sleeve length,2
but oh well,0
"the shirt fit as expected,",1
but material appears a bit thin,2
"as described, i wish it was more fitted,",2
but hey for the price its a bargain,1
the shirt's quality and fit is good,1
but i encountered 2 unexpected issues,2
"the second issue really isn't an issue,",0
but is noticable,0
"it isn't noticable when i'm wearing my suit jacket,",0
but i don't really like my tie partially exposed around the back of my neck,0
"while the mid section is cut a bit smaller , the sleeves are rather big",2
but i have never bought a shirt that fits this well,1
but no longer needed it so i had to return it,2
sleeves and color is fine,1
but not fitted around the mid section at all,2
"i tried to contact the seller to inform them,",2
but they were not responsive,2
5 shirts,0
but have worn one or two 16s,0
"the material is poplin, not burlap, so it is thin, which is great in the summer,",0
but you should probably wear an undershirt,0
"the shirts fit well and look good,",1
but the fabric of the shirts is somewhat thin,2
"i'm always hesitant about buying clothes online,",0
but i know my size and this shirt fit perfect,1
they do run a little small,2
but overall i have always been a van heusen shirt fan,1
shirt appears well made,1
"but time will tell, specifically regarding the quality of the threads,",0
but right now i have no complaints,0
this is the shirt you are looking for if you have big neck,0
but you are not big otherwise,0
"ordered white,",2
but got grey,2
i'm a regular guy,0
"but my neck is thicker than usual so i was looking for a shirt that fits me good,",0
but at the same time doesn't  squeezes my neck when i wear a tie,0
"first time ever buying a shift on line,",0
but was pleasently surprised at the fit,1
"was afraid in ordering a fitted shirt that it would be a bit tight around the mid section,",0
but this isn't an issue at all,1
"looks good,",1
"but the texture feels very inorganic, stiff and unpleasant on the skin",2
light,1
"but stiff, very nice",1
but i'm not huge either,0
"worn with a black tie and a black suit it does have a dramatic appearance,",2
"but everyone will likely ask you, as they asked me, ""are you going to a funeral?""",2
"their shirts are made from a polyester cotton blend that wears like an eighty dollar dress shirt,",1
but costs only twenty,1
i am not in retail,0
however i  think you should have more of a good product,2
"the 4 that i ordered earlier fit perfectly and still do,",0
but for some reason this one was too small,2
and i only by fitted or players slim fit,0
but for some reason this one fits me alot bigger than expected,2
"however, the way they packaged the shirt damaged it",2
"a little thin in the material,",2
but overall very nice shirt for the money,1
"very nice shirt,",1
but a rather loose fit,2
good looking shirt,1
"sleeves are a bit longer than i'd expected from the measurement given,",2
"but other than that, if you order a sleeve length an inch less than your standard measurements, i think you'll like the fit if the waist fits your gut",1
"i will personally be purchasing a slim fit shirt next time,",0
"but if you have a bit of a gut, this shirt will suit you better",0
"i ordered the wrong length sleeve and try to cancel and reorder,",0
but the wrong one came anyway even though the order said the cancellation was successful,2
the fabric is a bit low quality,2
but it washes well and fits perfect,1
i'm not slender,0
"but the van heusen fitted poplin shirts look good, feel good, and stay tucked in",1
took 3 tries,0
but finally got the right size for my husband,1
"great shirt, neck and arms are perfect,",1
"but for athletic cut, it's still quite large around the waste and chest",2
"it's smaller in this area than a classic fit,",2
but still a little large and baggy,2
"color not quite what i expected,",2
but still ok,0
"the shirt says ""fitted""",0
however,2
"while the neck and the sleeves were as measured, the body fit was huge",2
fitted shirts usually are too tight,0
but these fit perfectly,1
but that's just because i have a large neck,0
washes well,1
but may need an iron for a crisp look,0
this shirt is for you if you want a shirt that fits better than a regular fit,1
but not super slim,0
form fit,0
but not too tight,0
this shirts fits nicely,1
but it is too sheer,2
"i was hoping this dress shirt was going to be a handsome addition to my office ensemble,",0
"but unless i lose massive weight, the van heusen men's fitted poplin dress shirt is going to hang in my closet",0
"i bought the ""fitted"" narrower at the waist style by accident, and was worried when i opened the package,",0
but they fit wonderfully,1
i am not an exceptionally skinny guy,0
but this certainly wasn't fitted enough for my tastes,2
"the feel and quality of the shirt is excellent,",1
but the sizing is slightly off,2
"shirt will fit a larger, fit man",0
but also cover one who has a little bit of a belly,0
"i've bought this shirt in various colours,",0
"but for the first time one arrived damaged, the material near a shoulder was broken and i can't use it, out of 8 one arrived bad so i'm leaving 4/5 stars just for that",2
"the sleeves and collar feel fine,",1
but there was too much room in the chest,2
but it fit him great,1
"the material and overall quality is good,",1
but the collar is way too small in the back,2
"decent quality for the price,",1
"but these are not ""fitted,"" unless you are spongebob",2
"i was expecting a slim fit shirt,",0
but it seems kind of baggy,2
but i would not worry as long as this shirt is worn with a blazer or suit,0
wish they had a tall version,0
but the color was true to my computer monitor and i???very happy with the fit,1
but the sleeves are too huge like they can fit two people at the same time,2
but not significant enough to complain,0
fits the neck and sleeve,1
but the tail is way to short,2
nice shirt,1
but the arms and body of the shirt is too short,2
"however, not a fan of pure white",0
neck size and arm length were great,1
but it was to short,2
but it worked out will wash in cold water and will not dry,2
only criticism is the collar is a little scratchy,2
but this may not be a problem after a couple of cleanings,0
"it's ""fitted""",0
"but not slim fit, not baggy either",2
it is what one pays for -  not too comfortable and a bit small,0
but for &lt,0
the fit was pretty good,1
but a little short as compared to my liking,2
"but when my favorite arrow shirts became hard to find, i tried the van heusen fitted shirts",0
i didn't realize that they were fitted so they are a little snug in the waste,2
but nothing too,0
"it was the same size and brand,",0
but i did not notice that this shirt said fitted,0
"the sleeve length and collar was fine,",0
but the rest of it was huge,2
"great for the heavy set guy,",0
but not for me,0
did not arrive in one day which i paid more for,2
but the shirt does live up to expectation so i am happy with the product,1
but not the delivery,2
hard to find 17??neck,0
but 34 arm length,0
really nice shirt,1
but definitely not iron free,2
shirt is kind of see through so it will work well under a jacket,0
but if you have an undershirt on underneath it will be visible,0
"not the best quality,",2
but nice,1
"the quality is not so bad,",0
however i have to send it to the taylor to fix it,2
"it is starting to fade after 20 washes,",0
but that is not too bad,0
nice shirt,1
but was too small,2
the arms are perfect,1
material quality is good,1
but a little too shiny for my taste,2
"i normally wear the 17"" collar regular fit,",0
but go up to 17,0
"sleeve length and collar fit well,",1
but i felt like i was wearing a shirt for a much buffer man,2
"i was hoping for a slimmer fit,",2
but the shirt still works for what i need it for,0
it says fitted,0
but seems like it would do well on someone who had narrow hips,0
but still working on the belly,0
"it's a little bright,",0
but i like it anyway,1
"i like the color and everything,",1
but i go the wrong size,2
however it does seem to require ironing prior to wearing,0
it wasn't just fitted,2
but small no way it is the size ordered or shrunk ridiculously at cleaning before first wear,2
still a decent shirt,1
but come on,0
the shirt is okay,0
but the fabric is thin and feels cheap,2
it fits fine,1
but you can tell the quality isn't the same as that of some more expensive shirts,0
it was too large,2
but the neck size fit,1
"a great shirt, material is a little thin,",0
but it's fine as long as you have a good undershirt,0
"the fit is good,",1
but the material is very thin and transparent,2
a very thin shirt,2
but great for the price,1
shirts fit torso well,1
but arms are a bit loose causing the material to bunch when wearing with a suit,2
looks great,1
but not cut like most of the shirts i have bought in the past,2
i just got it,0
but it seems pretty sturdy,0
"everything about the shirt fit well,",1
but the length of it was a bit short,2
"ordered multiple dress shirts, same size and style",0
but different color,0
nice shirt for the price,1
but i returned them because  i should have ordered a regular fit,0
"this is a bit less billowy than their other offerings,",0
but still an improvement,1
"it is thin, so an undershirt is needed,",0
but i was expecting that,0
"i am able to wear medium dress shirts,",0
"but this ""medium"" is closer to small",2
looks nice and fits as described,1
"however, you start seeing some loose threads after several uses",2
"i usually have trouble getting sleeves long enough for me,",0
but this 35 sleeve was perfect even in the 15 1/2,1
"the material is a bit see-through,",0
"but looks great, fits great",1
"nice everyday shirt, a bit on the thin side",0
but i always wear an undershirt and together they work fine for my office,0
"sleves are a touch too short,",2
but a fantastic shirt in a great color,1
not as baggy as the regular fit shirt,1
but not much room to grow in the fitted style,2
"but for the price, it is a good shirt",1
"it's not terrible,",0
but i narrowed down my selections based on regular fit,0
"i'il will wear the shirt,",0
but its the type that you go to when you're low on clean clothes,2
"however, it's way too transperant",2
they needed an iron out of the packaging,2
but haven't had an issue since,0
"overall i'm satisfied with the product,",1
"however, i have to say that it comes a little big to be a ""fitted"" dress shirt",2
"i am 6'2 and the overall fit at the shoulders and sleeves is perfect,",1
however the length of the shirt isn't for taller people and really could use another two inches in length so that the shirt doesn't come untucked so easily,2
"this shirt is great,",1
"but i forgot to order it in tall, that being said, it fits as it should, just remember if you need it in tall",0
"body of the shirt fit well, the sleeves ran a bit baggy in my opinioni totally understand i got what i paid for",0
"well made otherwise,",1
but way too small for a shirt made with an 18 neck,2
this shirt fits great,1
but the long pointed collar looks really weird and old fashioned,2
"i could have been off on the sizing,",0
but this is a bit extreme,2
ok fit,0
they're a little too long for me,2
but seemingly true to size,0
"fitted,",0
shirt was nice,1
but the quality seemed good,1
thought the xl would be tight for me,0
"but it fit perfectly, love this shirt, might purchase more",1
"love the shirt, its longer than the 16 1/2 size i get at stores,",1
but i like it like that,0
"i assume some of this is because of the ""fitted"" cut,",0
"but during ordering and also on the shirt packaging, it indicates neck size of 15"" should have a waist size of less than 35""",0
"however, this one had to be mislabeled",2
"i have bought ""fitted"" shirts before",0
but this time i didn't have to take it be be tailored,1
fit great needed to be steamed to get wrinkles out,0
but was to be expected,0
"the neck is a little small so go a size up from your usual neck and shoulder size,",2
but other than that the length is perfect and the fit is good,1
the material is a little thin,2
but sharpens right up when pressed and starched,1
fits well enough,1
but i was expecting it to be slimmer in the torso since it is described as a fitted shirt,2
but fits and feels great,1
"this shirt, the sleeves were okay",0
but the diameter of the sleeves were too big making it feel really baggy,2
"was skeptical about buying a fitted shirt online,",0
but was very happy with purchase,1
needed the 18 and a half neck size,0
but not the bulk of a standard fit shirt,0
this is a nice shirt,1
but it is extremely roomy around the ribcage if you are on the slimmer side,2
"van heusen makes great shirts, and even though i'm barrel-chested",0
"but slimmer, the fitted works well and has a nice modern fit",1
i was worried about the name fitted because i weigh 245,0
but theres plenty of room,1
"neck size runs a little small,",2
"but shipping was fast, exchanges were easy, would recommend",1
"while fabric nice,",1
the sleeves were way short compared to the arrow brand shirt i also bought,2
"however, you can tell this is a cheap shirt",0
"finally,",0
hubby owns a couple of white shirts,0
but i got him this one and this is by far his favorite,1
"the torso fits as expected,",1
but the arms are not fitted and baggy,2
"nice shirt,",1
but the side seam came apart after only wearing it twice,2
"the fitted shirt is a great shirt for those who need room in the neck area,",0
but your body isn't that big for a roomy shirt,0
nothing fancy,2
but does it's job,0
"however,  it says it is a ""fitted"" shirt and it is far from that",2
fit very well,1
but it's see through,2
"it looks a little thin,",2
but i haven't tried it on yet,0
would like collar to be a little higher,0
but other than that they are fine,0
the chest area isn't bad,0
but its very long and the waist area is very big,2
they say it?????꼒tted??,2
but it???huge,2
the quality of the shirt seems very good,1
"but after more than 6 weeks to get the item after i ordered it, it doesn't fit",2
not a high end shirt,0
but great shirt for the money,1
great quality neck slightly larger than expected,1
but i believe it's due to me using a metal tape measure,0
"he's tall and built,",0
but this fits him perfectly and he wears it to work,1
"beautiful shirt,",1
but too small for me,2
i am used to cotton,0
but this is not too stiff,0
it fit right at the waist,1
but it was wide at the arms and back,2
"haven't washed it yet,",0
but the van heusen brand has yet to let me down,1
the length was good,1
but the shirt was too blousy to be considered fitted,2
"he is 6'2 and sleeves are often too short,",0
but he said these were great,1
"i was apprehensive to purchase any shirts other than my former brand,",0
but i think i may have found a new brand for all my dress shirts,0
its a nice shirt,1
"but is definitely not what i expected of ""fitted""",2
the shirt looks good,1
but it doesnt fit me,2
"the sleeves are not fitted like the rest of the shirt,",2
but is great for the price,1
the shirt is tagged fitted,0
but the hand /arm is way too large,2
"material seems a bit cheap,",0
"but then again, it was a cheap shirt",0
"some fitted shirts i have don't allow me to extend my arms at all,",0
but this one is more natural feeling and moves like i do,1
"the company it was good, it just don't have the regular size only the fitted wich is not me,,",0
"but it was okay,,",0
the neck fit well as well as the chest,1
but a little loose and long below the chest,2
not here,0
but same,0
they are fit,0
but not slim,0
when tucked into a pair of slacks there was a considerable amount of extra fabric,0
but not lengthwise,0
additionally the sleeves were quite large in circumference,2
but fit great in length,1
fits a little larger than i expected,2
but still a nice fit,1
"nice shirt,",1
but the neck was kinda small had to go up to a 16 despite it saying i should get a 15,2
"these run big,",2
but nicely fits once you find the right size,1
fit perfect,1
but the fitted cut always seems to so no surprise,0
the body of the shirt was baggy for being a fitted shirt,2
but i figured that would happen because his arms are so long i had to buy the larger option,0
it says fitted,0
but it's far too big,2
"needed to tailor arms to a smaller diameter,",0
but not by much,0
"i've happily worn 17 1/2, 34/35 fitted shirts for many years - most of them van heusen -",0
i bought this medium m slim fit shirt,0
"but this one it is xl minimum, in the label size the neck is 15",0
"i rarely leave bad reviews,",0
but this shirt was too awful to ignore,2
"i took a chance and was a bit concerned about buying without seeing,",0
but it was perfect,1
nice shirt,1
but not wrinkle free,2
my husband likes the look,1
but will need to shed a few pounds to have it less snug,0
i have never taken a size 17 as a dress shirt,0
but i felt like i would like to be a little bit more at ease than a 16 or 16,0
was a bit large,2
but bad part is it came already stained,2
great shirt,1
but was too small for me,2
it is lightweight,0
but i needed that for warm weather,0
a good materials and sizing,1
but the arms are way too large,2
it is tagged fitted,0
but i wonder how fitted shirt will have such a large arm,2
good quality,1
but sleeve length slightly too short from that stated on line,2
great shirts,1
but shirt was too small,2
i would buy again,1
but one size up,0
"but it works, it???a little baggy",0
great shirt,1
but the sleeves were too long,2
its a good shirt if you are looking to save money,1
but still need something for work,0
the quality seems very good,1
"but the test, of course, is after a few wears and washes",0
nice shirts,1
but too tight on chest and sleeves would have been too short after 1 wash,2
"i ordered size 16, 32/33 shirt",0
"however the item delivered,",0
"while labeled 16, 32/33, is more like size 16, 34/35",2
nice,1
but very sheer,2
the shirt is fitted,0
but somewhat large around the stomach,2
haven't worn yet,0
but look forward to that pleasure,0
product description says its fitted,0
but its somewhat large for me,2
"its a good product,",1
"but not what i was looking for, it was somewhat large for me, so returning",2
but i would recommend if anybody looking for a nice white shirt,0
but somewhat transparent too,2
cloth is not soft,2
but looks revived on body,1
very nice,1
but thin,2
"the fabric was not amazing,",0
but definitely suitable,1
"a little bit large,",2
but generally fits well,1
"tried to make it work in my wardrobe,",0
but it just isnt good enough,2
"ordered 161/2 34/35 - shirt fits ok,",0
but arms seem a little short,2
the arms were somewhat wide,2
but length was great,1
"it is exactly the shirt i was looking for for my husband,",1
but you dont want to pay for new shirts and then end up with holes in them,2
i had to reorder the shirts,2
but could not get free shipping so i only brought one and payed for shipping not very satisfied,2
"i have same exactly size and brand ,",0
but this one came out to be at least 4 sizes smaller than the one i got,2
he likes the shirt,1
but stated that the collar is not big enough for a tie,2
fit is nice,1
but it'd be nice if the collar was a little looser,2
"i figured that the shirt was more fitted than it is,",0
but seems like a  quality lightweight shirt with sturdy collar and cuffs,1
"i need a 34 inch sleeve,",0
however i can rarely find exact length sleeve with out spending big bucks,0
"actually the sleeve is too long as well as cloth itself,",2
while the neck is too tight,2
is a nice dress,1
but it somewhat small,2
"was worried about high polyester count,",0
but feels like cotton,0
"good fit,",1
but material was quite thin and see through,2
"i guess that is how it is meant to be,",0
but it will be an adjustment for my son,0
"i'm very muscular,",0
but i've definitely got a gut too: a powerlifter's build,0
nice shirt,1
but the fitted version was too small,2
good fit,1
but slightly small around the neck,2
"hard to find a shirt to fit a fat neck, fairly trim body and short arms",0
but this one does,1
they last a,1
while as well_,1
"the neck was a little tight on my husband, he does have a thick neck,",0
but the shoulders and arms fit as expected,1
neck size is okay,1
but the waist is too large and looks flabby,2
"i'm not sure how running the same measurements could have ended up fitting to what seemed like children's clothes,",0
but it did,1
good shirt,1
but just a bit larger than i expected,2
too small,2
but good quality,1
nice looking,1
but not the best quality i've seen,0
"it claims to be tailored at the waist,",0
but i could have easily fit my wife in the space that was left over,2
"sleeves are kind of shakespearean for a form fitting shirt,",2
but overall good fit,1
but the quality is good,1
this is a nice shirt,1
but dont buy it unless you are very thin,0
"however, it is a good shirt for work",1
"the size for my neck and sleeves is perfect, the length of the shirt could be shorter,",1
but it doesn't really bother,0
kinda bummed they were smaller than other shirts i have if the same size,2
but needed them immediately for work,0
the sleeve was a little too long for me,2
however otherwise it fit just fine,1
nice shirt,1
i know there are more high end products,0
but these always fit true to size for me and are priced about what they are worth,1
really bad quality,2
but cheap,0
but these do wrinkle less i suppose,0
"great shirt,",1
but the neck does not have the elastic like many van huessens,2
very clean,1
but a little to tight,2
it is a nice looking shirt,1
but feels cheap,2
nice looking,1
but bad feeling shirt,2
not the highest quality,0
but it will fit well into the wardrobe as an additional shirt,0
nice shirt,1
but it's a little short,2
i get you don't pay a lot,0
"but come on, i'd rather spend 50",1
very pleased with my purchase could have been a bit more fitted,1
but overall was a god purchase i will be ordering a few more,1
"the shirt is very nice,",1
but it didn't fit my big &amp,2
"the shoulders fit well,",1
i thought maybe it was from the detergent pods,2
but i stopped using them and the new shirts seem to get the same spots,2
"a bit different design as known from van heusen shops,",0
but still good,1
"since it is white, plan to use an undershirt,",0
but it isn't very thin and you almost don't need one,0
but it fit perfectly,1
"my neck is a 15 at the least, 14 1/2 is way too small,",2
but 15 1/2 shirts have too broad of shoulders,2
"the left side feels pulled in very slightly more than the right,",2
but only i could tell the difference because i was wearing the shirt,0
"however, the sleeves were not fitted in any way, so they were naturally very billowy and i need to get them properly fitted, which was not what i wanted to do and why i purchased this shirt in the first place",2
"seems to be good quality, delivered on time",1
but is huge,2
"there are more expensive shirts out there that might look better in a full suit,",0
"i'd give this 5 stars except they are not super excellent quality,",1
"but for the price, well worth it",1
"i like the ""fitted"" version-- it's not tight in the torso,",1
but not super blouse-y,0
shirt looks good,1
but is sized wrong,2
"van heusen claims this is a slim fit,",0
but i beg to differ,2
"the shirt was smaller around the waist,",2
but was still a bit baggy,2
"i have used them before,",0
but didn't get on time,2
"i was trying to find a green shirt,",0
but not able to come up with anything even close,2
ordered 2 by mistake and both are too large,2
but i opened them both,0
i_e had shirts of similar material,0
but never this bad,2
"first let me say i love van heusen when it fits,",0
"but no shirt is ever the same, two shirts of the exact same size will be vastly different",2
"haven't bought these through amazon yet,",0
but have bought them from every store i can find because it is one of the few shirts that fit me well,1
as a guy with a larger chest,0
"but 34"" waist, i 'slim fit' shirts do no fit me across the chest, and most 'regular fit' shirts are extremely baggy around the waist",0
these shirts have a tapered waist,0
while keeping more room in the chest,0
but they look very nice in a professional setting with dress pants or even a clean pair of jeans,1
these have lasted fine in the washing machine,1
"however i always take care to dry these shirts on low heat, or even hang dry if possible, and they all look as fresh as they day i bought them even over a year later",1
"i was worried about ordering a new dress shirt for my suit online,",0
but it was a perfect fit,1
"i ordered these as ""fitted"", they're labelled fitted,",0
but they don't fit as such,2
"i've never purchased the poplin specifically, so it may be the fact that these particular shirts are new to me,",0
but they didn't fit as expected,2
"it has a very thin material, can see his undershirt through it",2
but under a suit it looks good,1
my hubby says it_ a very cheap shirt,2
but it works for what we needed it for,1
"the neck and sleeve length are fine,",1
but the overall length of the shirt is better suited for a child,2
i was apprehensive about buying this online since i am picky when it comes to my white shirts,0
but i wish i would have gotten more,2
while it was on sale,0
"i'm 5'10"" / 175lb and i work out",0
"but i'm not ""athletic"" and could certainly lose a few pounds in the gut",0
"however, neck and sleeve measurements are spot on",1
"i don't know how it got so many five stars,",2
but i didn't like it at all,2
shirts are of good quality,1
but thin,2
nice material,1
but it fits very strangely for me,2
"it's supposed to be a fitted shirt,",2
but it was very loose compared to other dress shirts of the same marked size,2
"shirt is darker than picture,",2
but works well with my tan suit,1
could be a little longer,2
but still tucks in,0
love the shirt,1
but there was no front pocket so it is not as shown,0
"material is not superb,",0
but nice,1
"not that high of quality compared to other department store brands,",0
but it is a great value for a middle-of-the-road shirt,1
"the quality/color of the shirt was fine, what i expected",1
but this is not a wrinkle-free shirt,2
neck fits perfect,1
but shirt is not fitted,2
"after a few washes, the shirt softens a bit,",0
but then the fit isn't the same,2
"the size was ok ,",0
but the quality of clothe was very unexpected,2
it was good look when i ordered,0
but in real it was not,2
"bad things about it,",2
but overall 4/5 stars,0
is good,1
but could be longer to better and more fully tuck in,2
but it's fine and easy to switch if wanted,0
", not as ""thick"" as i would like,",2
"but this can be fixed by simply sewing in a small section of ""liner"" using invisible thread, just in the area where it shows when wearing a suit jacket / blazer - and most likely only if you're not wearing a tie since a tie might just cover it up anyways?  the entire rest is fine since it's covered by a jacket and makes it more breathable",2
i've only tried it on so far,0
"but it fit correctly, is of nice quality, and i would likely buy again",1
but i may be hard pressed to tell the difference later unless i lay one shirt on top of the other to measure,0
the regular one was ok,0
but the wrist openings were way too small,2
i hate ironing,0
but i'm not paying $60+ for a wrinkle free shirt,2
but my waist is 36 so i usually have shirts with excess material around the waist,0
but not these shirts,1
most large shirts have 35 inch sleeves,0
but van heusen  shirts had a choice of 32/33 inch sleeves,1
i tried to get 19 neck 35-36,0
but they don't have it,2
"would be perfect,",0
however it would be perfect fitting for men who has billy,0
"this one was sent in a slim fit that was great when i was 16,",1
but 8 inches too small in the body when i am 81 with a 46 inch waist,2
but the body is not extra-long to match,0
"ok to wear untucked,",0
but barely long enough to tuck in,2
but i did not return as it was comfortable although it makes me a bit fatter when wearing,0
we planned to get it even more fitted at the tailor,0
however we did not want to get the slim fit in case it would be too tight at the chest,0
"the shirt is a little sheer,",2
but can easily fix that with an undershirt,0
"cheap and decent,",1
but not a good looking shirt,2
i stopped unpacking once i noticed,2
"but otherwise it looked like a standard white dress shirt, material on the thin side",0
good fit,1
but a little warm because 65% polyester and only 35% cotton,0
the fit is great,1
but the color is much darker than the picture,2
the shoulders fit great,1
but the arms and waist is huge,2
the shirt fits great,1
i gave it to a friend who is a bigger size than me,0
but it was still very loose in certain areas,2
a little snug at chest -,2
but i am happu,1
just slightly larger,2
but overall good dress shirt,1
"loved for our pictures _ a little on the bigger side,",0
but still worked tucked in,0
it extremely fast and it was slightly a little bit,0
but my wife is smaller than a man so i think it's true to size,1
it fits still loose now,2
but better,0
"i'm sure there's all different type of factors like body styles, fit preferences, etc that go into deciding what's ""too small"",",0
"but unless you want a lose fitting shirt, just buy your regular size",0
it looked good on him,1
but he said it did feel a little tight,2
i thought it would give the feel of demin,0
but it still looked good on him,1
"i really like the styles that coofandy makes,",0
but their products take a bit of work to navigate,0
"not going to knock them on that, great on coofandy to cater to larger sizes with this shirt",0
but it's a bit of a mess wading through the sizing,2
"the shirt itself looks absolutely sharp and it's a killer look that's true to the pictures they put on amazon,",1
but they do describe it as denim so keep in mind what you're buying is a shirt that has a sharp looking denim effect,0
i never heard of this brand of shirts before,0
but when i saw it online i decided to try them out,0
"the reason i took one star away was because the photo makes it look like it's a blue material with burgundy red pocket accent,",2
"but when it arrived it was actually a denim fabric which was not quite what i was expecting, and it makes the shirt hotter and heavier than expected, and the pocket is actually a saddle tan ""leather"" strip, which makes the shirt look a little more ""cowboy"" than i wanted or expected it to",2
to be xl still too small for me in other brand xl it's my size,2
but the shirt it's excellent quality and very elegant,1
but just be where of the size chart,0
this may not be a good shirt to wear in really hot weather,2
"the cotton shirts run small, i_ usually a medium",2
but a large fits me perfect,1
the cotton shirts are a bit short,2
but i can still keep them tucked,0
the denim shirts are much better quality,1
but inconsistent in sizing,2
however the denim shirts are longer and the material is thicker and has a slight stretch to them,0
"love this shirt, i always have to take my shirts to alterations to get the waist reduce due to i'm 6'0"" 155lb with a 42""chest and 29"" waist i got the m and returned it, a bit larger for what i like,",1
"but my nephew is also 6'0""  160lb and he likes the way m fits him,  so i order s and that was it, i like the slim fit shirts look the sleeves and torso length are perfect, i have several coofany shirts and i'm sure i'll buy some more,  i get very nice complements and some times even for strangers  passing by",1
"the design is nice,",1
but i would only wear this shirt during winter,0
but that's not the real issue here,0
pretty decent shirt,1
but the flannel-looking pattern only extends to the inside of the cuff,0
"not sure about the larger sizes,",0
but the smaller sizes are not made for an athletic build,2
shirt looks great and material is above average,1
but i_ 5 7 165 with an athletic build and i bought a small hoping to have a slimed  fit,0
but i have about 6-7 inches of extra material around the waist creating that ballon look,0
in a nice slim fit shirt i usually wear a medium,0
however my size _mall is full of extra material,0
"my husband usually wears and that_ what i bought, it fits slightly large,",0
but still looks good on him,1
but it_ still a nice looking shirt and my husband wears it a lot,1
but this shirt actually looks really good,1
"i did not notice in the picture,",0
"but there are no ""shirt tails"" on this shirt",0
loved the style,1
but definitely not impressed with the quality,2
width wise it does run a little big,2
but likely would shrink a little after washing so pretty true in that regard,0
size s almost fits my waist,1
but the arms err on the side of almost being too short,2
"teeny bit big and i like my stuff tight,",0
"but just a teeny bit, so it_ good",1
also everything is a size larger it seems,1
"i like the material and design,",1
however the xx-l is more like a large,2
it did come with a strong denim smell,0
but that seemed to wash out,0
"i still used for a year so i think is ok,",0
but not perfect beacuse this strange behaviour,2
"it's well made and the material is a strange sort of shiny denim,",1
but it's too big on me,2
"however, someone full figured or with long arms would not fit this",2
super stylish and wanted to keep it,1
but it wouldn't work,2
"okay, so i know that my wasit is a bit wider",0
but 2xl typically fits fine,1
i wear a large typically,0
but due to recommendations of other reviews i went medium,0
tbh i could have gotten away with smedium,0
but that???not a size,0
the fit of the large was a little bigger than expected,2
but not by much,0
"says true to size,",0
however it is not,2
would return,2
but not worth the cost and time to do so,2
"my disappointment stems from the fact that they are advertised as american sizing,",2
"however, they clearly utilize asian sizing for their builds",2
i'd have to buy a 4 or 5xl in their current sizes,0
but they don't carry anything over 2xl,2
the sleeves fit nicely,1
but the body is very boxy,2
but i normally fit loose in a 3x this 3x shirt fits like a large on me,0
"the shirt fit as expected for an xl, which is just a tad big for me,",0
but a regular large is a tad small,0
"unfortunately i'm stuck in the middle,",0
as a gift for son whom is small frame and wears small in mens,0
but this shirt runs bigger,2
but its a really nice shirt thou,1
loved the style of this shirt,1
but the color is not light grey,2
i like the way the shirt looks,1
however it fits me tight,2
slightly bigger then i would prefer,2
but good,1
"but it's definitely a ""modern"" or ""slim"" fit",0
the shirt has good style,1
but the fit is just a little to baggy for me,2
i got a med size and %99 of the time that fits well and snug,0
but not in this case,2
not upset,0
but also not excited about this shirt,0
it???a little snug than i like,2
but it???not awful,0
but shirt is nice quality,1
the material or color isn't what i was expecting,2
but not bad enough to return,0
i thought i liked the material on the pocket,1
but i'm guessing buy the way it looks it won't hold up for very long,2
but after a few washes it begins to shrink,2
"this was a smidge big,",2
but he loves it so much he kept it and wears it often,1
color was nice,1
but returned the item,2
intended for a western theme party,0
but under 90 degrees heat,0
"i like the way this look,",1
but it runs a bit small,2
"fit is fine,",1
"but he is slim and about 5""7",0
the treads in a few spots aren???perfect,2
but i don???think anyone else would notice,0
but still ok,0
they won???replace it,2
but they won???fully refund me either,2
the material was fine and as expected,1
"but due to being to oversized, it was unwearable and i had to return it",2
i like the style,1
but not thrilled with how the product was made,0
don't get me wrong it looks good,1
but for the price i could have bought a better one if i would have gone to the store maybe 10 dollars more= a way better one,2
"so disappointed, i would have tried the 5xl",2
but with the 4 not being close i chose against it,2
the material isn???what i was expecting,2
but that won???be an issue,0
usually wear a 3x,0
but after reading the reviews chose 4x,0
"the size chart is correct, i have a 46 inch chest and got the xl,",0
"however, i would probably recommend the xxl so it doesnt feel as snug",0
i received a shirt marked xxl,0
however it is more larger than a typical large shirt,2
got a large,0
but fit like a medium had to return and got the extra large still a little tight,2
but not restricted,0
"this shirt looks nice,",1
"however, it is way too small",2
could be good,0
but not for people with broad shoulders,0
the shirt is somewhat small or a medium,2
but i still can wear it,0
the shirt style was very nice ??the issue is that ordering a size larger than needed,0
but the fit design was not designed for a large 4x individual ??i usually wear a 2x or 3x,2
but there is no way you could wear this shirt in public ?? sorry,2
but will not order from this company in the future as it appears they have no idea what size is 2x or 4x ??ugh,2
but it is small,2
i could  go for more length to tuck in,0
but the trendy look is what i was going for,1
"i liked the design,",1
but it???cheaply made from the fabric to the fake pocket,2
but that's my always issue,0
"also,",0
"while the shirt is nice, it's prone to wrinkle",1
"nice shirt,",1
but runs very small,2
he has a little weight around the middle so it fits snug,0
but said it helps him with the final motivation to lose it,0
it fits good,1
but cheap material,2
"however, i work in the hot california sun and it might be too thick for the summer months",2
"bought for my teenage son, he loves it, casual",1
but still nice looking,1
nice shirt,1
but will bleed on to clothes unless you wash once maybe twice,2
too bad this product didnt fit me i was really looking forward to wearing this shirt,2
but i'm a big dude i guess 4x in china is different than in usa bummer,0
it was,0
however too small and the size comparison was much farther off than i would have expected it to be,2
i love it,1
but it run a lil small,2
great style,1
but on a dmaller fitted side,0
normal size is xl so got the xl,0
but too tight,2
might be a great shirt for someone looking for a heavy duty denim shirt,0
but for what i was looking for it did not meet the mark,2
"the shirt is a good shirt, well made,",1
but it unfortunately runs too large,2
i normally have a medium in shirts,0
but this shirt in a medium looked like a tent on me,2
"bought a 4xl for my husband,",0
but was way too small,2
this seemed like a quality shirt,0
but proved too small to try on,2
"it is a very nice shirt, nice material, great color,",1
but the pocket is fake,2
i'm not a big guy,0
but i got an xl just in case,0
"not sure why i don???like it,",2
but in person it???just so so,0
"1 "" chest,",0
however this shirt was too small,2
but stiched on cheaply,2
"very good quality, i was worry about the ""leather"" part",1
"but it is good quality too, totally getting more shirts from this shop",1
love the look of it and material,1
but 2xl did not fit,2
"this shirt was really pretty,",1
but 2 sizes too small,2
"i would have gladly exchanged it for something similar,",0
but was not,0
this shirt makes my husband look really comfortable,1
but it does run a little small,2
"the shirt is nice,",1
but the material is a little thin,2
wish i hadn???wasted my money,2
but cutting my lose,2
picture shows it to be more fitted and slim in the torso,0
but it was much wider and blousy,2
it???definitely a nice shirt only thing wrong with it is that the bottons ain???put on to good so just have to be careful with them,2
but other than that great shirt,1
it doesn???look like a true extra large i hope it fits this is for a gift,0
but the quality seems very nice,1
"nice shirt,",1
but it came damaged,2
"however, the chosen size is small for me",2
i usually wear 3xl,0
but i ordered a 4xl because of comments from other customers,0

thia shirt fit,0
but slightly a little bigger than expected,2
i???not a fit guy so the waist is very small still fits,0

"however, bits too small",2
"my boyfriend id going to look into getting it tailored,",2

fit a little bit small,2
but it worked,0
"love the look of the shirt,",1
but it was too small,2
i wear an xl,0
but i ordered an 2x glad i did,0
the shirt looked good on,1
but it has a weird smell to it,2
the fake chest pocket was a bit disappointing,2
but in no way a deal breaker,0
not 100% like in the picture,0
but was a decent buy for the price,1
"nice shirt,",1
but size is too small,2
the quality of material and construction are absolutely amazing,1
but the sizing is not true to what is listed i bought a 4x i would have to have bought a 6x or 7 x for it to actually fit me,2
the shirt looks nice and fits well,1
but has some kind of chemical on it,2
it's reduced after a few washes,2
but refuses to go away,2
but it's a nice shirt,1
"ran a bit small,",2
but i guess it is a nice gift for my roommate,1
sleeves are a little bit long,2
but not big deal,0
but this is okay if you wear an undershirt,0
"the shirt was beautiful,",1
but was not true to size,2
they say fits as expected,0
but it fits a size smaller than expected very frustrating,2
"the small i ordered for myself, toned build-  145lbs at 5'8 tall is rather tight around my armpits,",0
but it is a great shirt nonetheless,1
i ordered a 4x size shirt and what i got was a shirt that says 4x,0
but it fits like a extra large or a 2x,2
"a little blue gets on fingers otherwise,",0
"but either way, no big deal",0
"the shirt itself is breathable, light,",0
but not too thin,0
i ordered an xl,0
but it was a little too big,2
"i bout a xxl, because i know these may run small and i normally wear a l/xl,",0
but this was smaller than that,2
thought it was a flat black,0
but it turns out that the material it too shiny for my taste,2
it is some small that i expected,2
but i like it,1
it fit him perfectly,1
but he's a lean guy,0
nice shirt,1
but runs 2 or 3 sizes too small,2
"the colour was brilliant just as advertised,",1
"however, the material quality was disappointing it was very synthetic and not a breathable material",2
fits a little snug,2
but he said he???wear it,0
"design is awesome,",1
but it still decolorates after several washes,2
lol i am writing this review at work,0
but yes great s*** i am 5-11 200 pounds and i got the xxl,0
a little tight in chest,2
but a good slim fit,1
fabric is close to that of denim,0
but feels great,1
but not too restricting,0
it is,0
"however, well made",1
nice looking,1
but it shrunk and i have to give it away,2
"however the did provide extra, so i sewed the missin one",0
i received it,0
but its the wrong size can i send it back for and xl,2
fits a little small,2
"but actually for the best-looks great, good quality material",1
the shirt is great the only issue i had was i brought a large kinda fit like a xl,0
but the material is great for the winter weather,1
fit as expect and nice shirt,1
but the shirt stained my shirt under,2
it was hard to shop for my size,0
but you all did an amazing job,1
not the same color as shown,2
but still nice,1
fits a bit tighter,2
but overall decent,1
but it looks nice,1
"the shirt was s size,",0
but is too large maybe l size and the quality was  like a jean,2
the shirt looked good it was just bigger then i expected,2
but that was on my end,1
it said order to fit your usual size,0
but it was too small,2
the size was a little smaller than expected,2
but the quality was great and it looks really nice,1
the shirt is nice,1
but not true to size,2
"like the fit and styling,",1
but disappointed that the shirt pocket is fake,2
"i like the style,",1
but size is not good,2
i felt it was a little short,2
but overall very nice shirt,1
very thin,2
but looks good,1
but it is a nice product,1
the only thing is it stained my white jeans,2
but still was satisfied with the product,1
it is cool,1
but the sizes just run a little small,2
"looks/ feels a little different from what i was expecting,",2
but fits perfectly,1
"great shirt,",1
but the pocket is fake,2
but it fits like a small or extra small,2
but i notice a strange smell on it,2
sexy-ass design,1
but its too small and a bit short on the arms,2
but it turned white undershirt blue,2
shirt is nice,1
but the large fits like a small,2
"for sure not the worst product,",0
but surely wouldn't go out of my way to buy from seller again,2
but not terrible,0
"looks great,",1
but you would have to be 40 pounds underweight to fit in the sleeves correctly,2
but i am glad i ordered an l and it fits perfect,1
"looks nice,",1
but way too small,2
i usually wear an 11,0
but after i received my shoe they looked amazing,1
but they were about a size to big,2
i liked the look,1
but the shrit was cut weird and way too small,2
"is nice,",1
but the quality  was not what i expected,2
shirt fits and looks nice,1
but the length is too short,2
"however, its a nice shirt",1
it's  nice,1
but i little big for me if you order xl order a l ???2,2
looks good in pictures,1
but not so good when you get it,2
very nice material,1
but very tight fit,2
it fitted a bit big,2
but it's ok,0
the arms fits well,1
but the body is short and loose,2
great quality,1
but ran on the smaller side,2
i got a medium,0
but they run small so get a size bigger,2
this was purchased as a gift for my husband,0
but it did not fit well,2
but the shirt was very short length wise,2
however the company did contact me regarding a refund,0
but not a fitted shirt i was hoping it to be,2
great shirt really like it,1
but i ordered it one size big and happy i did,1
shirt is really fitted it will work for now,1
but next time i might get 2 sizes bigger just in case,0
but it's like a large,0
"i'm 6-2, 225 w/toned",0
but not bulky build,0
i normally wear xl,0
but bought xxl based on the recommendations and glad i went up one size,0
"generally what i've found is that a large would actually fit,",0
shirt feels a little awkward just a little too short to wear tucked,2
"however, when i tried it on, the sleeves and overall length were great",1
"but the cavity of the shirt is huge - there was no where near a form fitting look, it is more for someone who is heavy set as there is too much extra space and it is very loose fitting",2
to be clear i didn't expect anything special when i purchased this shirt,0
but it was below my expectation,2
hoping after a wash the shine will fade,2
but definitely not pleased,2
the material is soft and the design looks good,1
but there's some threads popping out on the front and it really just doesn't fit me tight enough,2
"even when i tucked it in, it looked better",1
but it still popped out of the edges of my pants and look like a woman's blouse,2
"great, i was worried that size would be wrong,",1
but fits  perfect,1
however the stiching isnt great,2
"not the worst shirt,",0
but definitely not the greatest either,0
