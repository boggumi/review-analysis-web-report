  Dear Potential Buyers.<br>before you buy I would like you to know a few facts about this product.<br>1) The color is cream - close to ivory;  it is not white, in fact it is far from white.<br>2) If you have a high performance job (a waiter,  a barman or you spend some  hours in office wearing the  suit), than you will feel like wearing a plastic bag - wet and uncomfortable with strong sensation of aching.<br>3) The information (on website and on shirt's  label indicates that it is 100% cotton. It is not. It is 100% polyester, uncomfortable to use.<br>4) This shirt,  20-30 minutes after ironing, will lose it shape, and you will look like a rickshaw  driver after very long rainy day.<br>5) The price for 100% polyester shirts is usually 70% cheaper  than cotton, because difficult to wear in cold or hot days.<br>6) From the ethical point, looks like ""Amazon"" is taking very  strange business direction, by selling polyester as a cotton.<br>7) It is not ""Essential"" it is ""Strategic Mistake"".<br>I returned the item. Not acceptable.

  I purchased a 16‚Äù 32-33‚Äù French Blue shirt.  Very much liked the color, the fabric, the fit when I first tried it on.  It washed up nicely.  I liked it so much that I anticipated buying two to three more.  So, what‚Äôs the problem?  Well, when I put it on and with my hands at my side everything is great, however if I move my arms or do almost anything, the sleeves become 1-3 inches too short and I must return my hands to my sides and pull the sleeves back down.  It seems like the shirt is just too small across the back.

  I'm really happy I decided to order one of these shirts. I was looking to buy a red/blue tattersall and when I saw this, I figured it was worth a shot. I typically wear Brooks Brothers non-iron shirts, and while these aren't the same quality, they are definitely comparable to brands such as Calvin Klein. For the money, it is a fantastic value and I would have given it 5 stars had it not run pretty small. This is marketed as a 'regular fit', and while I am certainly a large guy (6'3 250), I expect a regular fit shirt to be relatively loose fitting given the measurements I buy (17.5, 35). This will not fit you if you are, sorry, very overweight or obese. I am going to order a 18"" neck next time and see how it fits.

  I bought this dress shirt from Amazon Basics and another dress shirt of the same size / color Kirkland brand from Costco as a test for which $20 men's long sleeve dress shirt is better. Costco wins. Comfortably.  The Amazon Basics shirt looks thinner and cheaper. It's fabric is a bit stiffer and less comfortable. Either the sleeves are a bit shorter for the listed size, or the shirt shrank -- neither of those options is good. Lint and fuzz cling to the Amazon shirt more, even though I washed it and the Costco shirt at the same time.<br><br>Overall, it's not an awful shirt, but if you've got access to a Costco, the choice for a $20 men's dress shirt is easy, and it's not Amazon Basics.

  These dress shirts are great! They are a nice white, fit well and awesome price! Can‚Äôt beat 20 bucks for a dress shirt anywhere else!<br>I first got this size shirt in the slim fit but was a little too tight for me, wanted more maneuverability of my arms (some people might like that tight though). So returned it no problem and got the regular fit and couldn‚Äôt be happier. Absolutely love it! Must buy! Oh and it really is non-iron! Comes out of wash great!

  This shirt surpassed my expectations for this price point.  I have been ordering another brand from Amazon and the quality of the Amazon Essentials shirt is so much better and the fit is better.  For all my dress shirts, this is going to be the shirt I buy.  When I lose a little weight, I will be buying Amazon Essential pants also.  Everything I have bought from Amazon Essentials so far has been excellent quality at an affordable price.  I'm hooked!!

  I bought this for my husband after I ran one of his white shirts in a colored wash and it came out gray.  He put this on as soon as I have it to him and really loves it.  I did notice that it is a bit see-through.  But he doesn't mind that his undershirt shows through.

  This is a very well constructed shirt for the average size man...highly recommend, but if you are a BIG size man; then this is not the shirt for you.  It is way to small in the stomach.  The sleeves and neck size are fantastic.  Fantastic price!

  This is the first time I have been disappointed by Amazon Essentials and I have bought several other items - which were all good.  The fabric used for this shirt is just not right. The label says cotton but I have my doubts.  Too shiny and doesn't feel right. Super grabbed lint, etc.  Reminds me of a gangster shirt.  Someone at Amazon Essentials dropped the ball.  I will never wear this shirt.  Sorry, Amazon, but this is bad.

  I got the Van Heusn, a Steve Land, and 2 AMazon shirts. Steve Land was 10$ more than others Van Husen was 23, Amazon was $20.<br>Steve Land was the best as the black was a real black. Fit was great and so was the fabric 100% cotton. THIN, but I wear a black undershirt. Still thin<br><br>Amazon Essential 2nd best(NOT the Solid Poplin, this was wrongly sized), as it is almost a black indigo. You cant tell unless you hold it up with a actual black shirt or if you are matching black pants, it can be a issue in day time. Also it is 100% cotton, fit is a bit snug on chest , BUT it may get worse with washing.<br>I also purchased a 2nd Amazon shirt which fit great and the fabric was not see through, and it was more a casual threading as it has a micro wrinkle look vs a candle wax like dress shirt look. This is a great shirt also, yet suffers the dye ink of the indigo black, and not a true black.<br>Still I am keeping these and returning the VanHusen. I was never a fan of them, and now I know why a few discerning others felt the same.:-)<br><br>This shirt is the Wrinkle resistant, regular fit, and besides the size measures it shows a L/XL/XXL indication. The ""Poplin essential"" does not show that and the midsection stomach area runs rather tight for a 37"" sleeve with 18""neck. The midsection was a tight 46.

  I love the quality of this shirt, the fitting, and the price.  This shirt outshines the $60.00(men's warehouse) shirts I usually buy in terms of all of the above.  Not to knock my other shirts, because I still love them as well but I am definitely buying these from now on.  I am 5'7"" and 180#, a little on the chunky side.  I used to lift weights so my chest(I dont know the size) is a little bigger, not in the way I would like-so a nice, good looking fit is sometimes difficult to achieve, but this shirt manages to make me feel comfortable and make me look nice and fitted.

  This review is based on wearing the shirt once all day.  I ordered an 18 1/2 neck 34-35 sleeve length.  I am 6 feet 250 LBS.  I am pleasantly surprised that the shirt fit perfectly and irons easily.  It did not feel like I was wearing a piece of linen--it did not become wrinkly even after wearing it all day.  The fabric kept it's shape all day like the comparable premium store bought brand.  Note that this shirt is a classic fit with the traditional fabric (not the stretch-flex kind).  I cannot vouch for it's durability over time but for the price, I will come back to buy another.

  These were a replacement because I couldn't find the shirt I purchased prior. It appears Amazon replaced a prior shirt with this version. In any case I bought these for my boyfriend and the material is definitely a lower quality. Not nearly as soft and the neck chafes him so badly that he can't wear these shirts. you'll also want to be sure not to wash it with anything else because it picks up everything else in the washer and dryer.<br>It's a shame really because the shirt itself fits perfectly fine. Disappointed and searching again. üòî

  I just got this a few days ago and washed it. It fits well. The only issue I have is that the collar stays can come out in the washing machine/dryer and get lost (over the past years, I have only bought shirts that have collar stays sewn in so they don‚Äôt get lost). I basically drilled two small holes in the stays and sewed them into the collar, and they now stay in.<br>At this price, And otherwise good quality, I am happy to buy more and see the collar stays in the other shirts also.

  I was looking for a full cut shirt that could be worn untucked.  I ordered 15.5X32-33. These shirts are very nice but the cut is too snug for me.  Also, the sleeves were definitely 32 and not 33.  I'm 5'10"" and weigh 170.

  I ordered this shirt and it ripped in the area pictured after a few wears.  There was no excessive use or wear at that point in my opinion so I submitted a return.  Amazon graciously offered me a new shirt.  I was supposed to return the other one, and didn‚Äôt so I ended up being charged for both.  That‚Äôs fine because it was my fault for not returning the shirt.  But now the second shirt has also ripped in a similar fashion (the one pictured).<br><br>Just a heads up that these shirts appear to have a flaw.

  I bought two of these shirts because I needed the 16 1/2 neck size. I really like how easy it is to button the neck button because I had a mild stroke five years ago that affected my left hand a bit. The fit is perfect and the quality is first class. Being retired I don't wear a dress shirt that often, but when I do  I don't want to have to fight to get dressed. Buy this shirt. You won't be disappointed.

  Have been buying Amazon essentials white shirts for a while.  Recently started noticing that the shirt buttons are cracking or cracked.

  With regard to material, these amazon 100% cotton shirts are not as high-quality as ""designer"" 100% cotton shirts like you could buy in department stores.  The problem is it's hard to find 100% cotton shirts in the department stores these days, at least out my way.  The shirt fits well--not that ""slim fit"" for guys that eat one lettuce leaf a day.  For the price, it's a very good shirt.

  These shirts fit great and look very sharp. My only complaint is that the collars fabric is very rough. Wearing this shirt all day is impossible for me since it makes my neck feel raw. I solved this by buying a piece of disposable stick on fabric that serves as a collar protector. It‚Äôs the only way I can wear these shirts comfortably.

  You get what you pay for with this shirt. The fabric is very thin and the sleeves are too short, particularly when you bend your arms. I was disappointed as I really like the Amazon polo t-shirts for warmer months, but I won't be buying any more of these.

  My only gripe is that I was expecting the stripes to be more subtle and less bold.

  I wanted a new white all-cotton shirt. Contrary to some other reviews, my shirt had a front pocket. I am 5'8"" and 130"" and the 15"" x 32""/33"" shirt fit me fine.

  I love this shirt. It is nicely breathable, fits like it should, and the collar keeps its form. Iron it with a little spray starch and it looks like it came from dry cleaners. I have lots of higher end, more expensive shirts, but this one is in my weekly rotation during the summer.

  33""-34"" is the normal length of long sleeves that I wear. The first shirt I ordered with 32""-33"" sleeve length, but they were too short. Fortunately, the shirt fit my son perfectly. Since I really liked the shirt, I reordered 34""-35"" sleeve length and it fits me well.

  The shirt fits great and looks good out of the dryer. Unfortunately even after ironing it looks like it has static cling. I like that the Amazon essential regular fit shirts can be ordered by neck and sleeve size. The Amazon shirt fit at the waist is not baggy  and tucks in nice.  Unfortunately I will not be purchasing again due to the unprofessional look of the shirt even after ironing.

  This review is for the white version.  It's a very nicely made shirt, and all of the seams are impeccable with a very small number of uncut threads in places.  I find it to be true to size, with one caveat regarding the sleeves.  The sleeve length is perfect with my arms down, but the sleeves ride up more than those on my other dress shirts when I raise my arms.<br><br>These have removable collar stays, which is my preference.<br><br>The one thing that I like the least (and the reason for four stars instead of five, even at this price) is that the fabric is more transparent than my other shirts.  At least with the white color, you'll see skin or an undershirt through it.  It's not horrible, mind you, but I prefer a more opaque fabric.<br><br>All in all, a nice shirt and a good value at the (current) $20 price point.
"

  This is a beautiful, pure white shirt.  When I get a new white shirt, I do not usually take it out of its wrap that it comes in, because white shirts begin to age immediately, they begin to turn yellowish or dull.  That is why men who must wear suits and ties to work must have a constant new supply of white shirts with long sleeves, in order to look their best,  The men get to the point when they can spot an older white shirt on a colleague, and then they start to think less of this colleague.  You can solve this by occasionally wearing a blue shirt or a yellow shirt, if it matches your suit and socks, but best practice is to wear a gleamingly new white shirt.  It must have long sleeves, as it is unprofessional to show your arms bare, even on the hottest days.  N.B. This goes for women too - a businesswoman should not show bare arms.  Or too much neck.  It is unprofessional.  As for hemlines, below the knee is best.  I am an expert on dressing for the corporation, after having worked in the corporate world most of my life.  Anyway, back to this shirt.  As I said, I opened it and tried it on, and the sleeves are a bit too long.  Too long is better than too short.  Too long can be solved with a pair of good, old-fashioned sleeve garters that are white so that they don't stand out.  Sleeve garters can be found at haberdashery shops or sometimes in the men's department of a good department store.  So, you should have sleeve garters on hand.  The size of a shirt is determined by the neck size.  Unfortunately, I have always had a sensitive neck, so I must get a shirt with a neck size of 17 at least.  This way I won't be pulling at my neck all day long.  The top button must always be fastened or you will look slovenly.  Also, your tie must be tied properly - a double Windsor knot is best.  Please do not use a clip-on tie or a bow tie.  Once in a while, a bow tie is acceptable - maybe once or twice a year, and it must be 100% silk - in fact, all ties must be 100% silk and you are judged by your tie's design and color.  I have at least 150 ties.  I do not wear striped ties.  I prefer ties with abstract designs, paisleys, and other different designs, and ties must look fresh and unwrinkled.  The color of a tie is important.  I tend toward blues, purples, and lavenders, with intricate patterns.  Once in a while I'll wear one of my favorites - a water-colored street scene in Paris, or a dark blue tie with light blue colored turtles that I bought in Switzerland - but do not wear favorites over and over.  I have a black tie with red polka dots on it that I wear when I don't feel good.  When you have many ties, you can just grab one in a hurry and wear it and it'll be fine.  Again, back to the shirt.  If you can see your skin through the shirt, you must wear a well-fitting white undershirt with short sleeves.  You don't want to show your nipples or an extremely hirsuit body, or any scars (I have had heart surgery so I always wear an undershirt).  To wrap this up, this is a good and useful shirt, but you must adhere to what I have said if you wish to appear well dressed.  5 stars!

  Amazon brands are increasing their scope of affordable products especially in their clothing lines and this shirt is a great example. The colors and pattern is conservative  enough to be warn in a business setting but is equally at home at a relaxed casual outing. Equally at home under a suit or paired with blue jeans or khakis. Construction and cut share details of shirts costing twice the price. The collar stays for example are removable and can be replaced with new plastic ones or metal inserts if you have them. The sleeves have dual buttons to accommodate your wrist size or watch  and the  sleeve placket also has a button.  Extra buttons are sewn inside the bottom of the front packet to replace any that might come off over time. Stitching is clean and straight. There's a single front breast pocket and the alignment of the fabric pattern matches perfectly the underlying shirt pattern, which is critical in plaid shirt especially. Price is very affordable especially if you compare it to any designer label. Money was saved on the shirt fabric as it is a lightweight cotton and suitable, but it isn't a more substantial weave and cotton you would expect to find on a fine shirt. So while entirely suitable and attractive it will not replace a high end shirt if that's what you're expecting. I received the 32/33 inch sleeve and 16"" neck which I should not have ordered knowing my arms are extra long, and as expected, if I stretch my arms out straight, the sleeves are just not long enough. The cut leans more toward an athletic cut so works best with a slimmer torso. All told, a very good value for the price. Attractive and versatile.A small deduction for the lower end weight and lack of heft of the fabric.

  My husband seems to wear a popular size when it comes to dress shirts, so finding them in the local stores can be tough-so I often order online.  For the most part-men's fitted shirts like this (sized collar and sleeve length) seem to fit pretty universally, but for some reason I found this a bit big when he tried it on.<br><br>Granted many companies now make a 'regular' fit and slim fit.  This is a regular cut, but still seems a bit big in the chest area.  However, a good white shirt is always needed-and because this one seems to run a bit big, my husband can wear it with our without a tie-with for work, without for a more casual, business look.<br><br>The shirt is well made-buttons sewn on properly, cuffs stitched nicely and the collar lies flat.  The material is soft without being too sheer, but has enough rigidity to not look sloppy.  And the price point makes this a steal; less than $25 for a well made, men's dress shirt?  Yes please!
"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Overall, I like this shirt -- it fits pretty well, it's attractive, and it's well-made.<br><br>Fabric is strong without being rough or stiff. Seams are clean and strong.<br><br>The plaid pattern is muted and attractive. Fits in with what all the other guys at my office job are wearing.<br><br>My one complaint is that the arms/shoulders are a bit snug. I've cultivated a bit of a belly over the years, and this fits well through the midsection, but it's just a touch tight through the shoulders, and it's snug enough on the arms that flexing my bicep makes me feel like the Hulkamaniac.<br><br>On the other hand, it's a dress shirt. It doesn't give enough freedom of movement for the secret service, but if you're like me and you spend 8 hours sitting in front of a computer, it's not going to be a problem.
"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This is a quality dress shirt and a bargain at the price -- take that, designers!<br><br>I have deducted one star because arm movement is slightly restricted -- if you raise your arms, the shirt body lifts up as well.  A little more give under the arms would be welcome.<br><br>Otherwise, though, the shirt has everything I like -- a chest pocket, spread collar with slots for stays, two spare buttons attached to the hem, a good long hem, etc.<br><br>The finish seems topnotch -- no loose threads -- and the fabric is 100% cotton for breathability.<br><br>The colors are subdued in this purple tattersall version -- they appear to be a muted purple and gray.<br><br>All in all, then, this is a great shirt for the money, and the movement issue probably won't matter to workers sitting at desks...

  It is hard to believe that this shirt can be offered at its price point.  What an incredible value for $20.  I usually wear a medium or 15 and 1/2 inch neck and the fit was right on.  This is a very good quality dress shirt with modern styling.  The material is thin, which I like as it permits an undershirt and takes an iron well.  Thicker shirt material tends to be more difficult to iron.  Cant speak about longevity, so you may want to bump up in quality if you plan to wear frequently.  The design is a bit dull and it would be great if they had some more colorful and progressive patterns.  However, for an occasional dress shirt user who is on a budget, I just don't see how you could go wrong.
"

  And I mean that.<br><br>The shirt is 100%, all in, designed for the office.  It's the archetypal dress shirt.  While yeah, I guess it *could* be used for casual wear...it's not going to look casual.  It's going to look like you're trying too hard.<br><br>Everything about the tailoring and materials just says ""wear me with a suit and tie.""<br><br>The shirt itself fits just right to size - sleeve length is appropriate, shirttail length is appropriate, and the material is thin enough to be comfortable under a jacket.  In sum, a perfectly suitable, not-fancy-just-classic dress shirt.  A very good piece.

  I've had good luck with a lot of Amazon Essential stuff, so I'm really surprised about this shirt.  First, it doesn't fit well.  The belly is too tight and the shoulders are...  they manage to be both tight and loose at the same time, don't ask me how.  The material is also somewhat stiff and uncomfortable, not at all like some of the others.  And lastly, the pattern is much bolder than the picture lead me to believe.
"

  This is a great basic dress shirt that goes with anything. It fits well and came out of the wash without shrinking. It's 100% cotton, so it takes a light steaming or ironing, but doesn't need a lot. I wear dress shirts several times a week, and this is one of my new favorites. The double pleats really help with range of shoulder motion. I'm adding this shirt in outher colors to my wardrobe ASAP!

  This is a thinner fabric, but not flimsy or super-sheer. The construction is of good quality, and it looks very polished and classy. Great value. You can always pay more for higher quality textiles, but for basic button-down-white-shirt, this is a very economical one that presents well.

Any better than 6 months and I'd say it's worth the money, though I'd rather spend more for something that will last longer.<br><br>Only complaint is that there are little plastic bits in the collar to keep it pointed. My collar only had one of these in place, as the little pocket for them is left open on one end. Must have fallen out somewhere along the way...

  These shirts are a really good deal. They fit as expected, though they're a little long. Shouldn't pose a problem, though. Material is nice, will probably work well in the warmer weather. It looks sharp, will do very nicely for the office. Wish there was some way to be notified when the other colours I want in my size come back in stock.

  This product appears and feels on the cheap side.  But for $26 it is not bad, I just expected more.  If Amazon Essentials were to come out with a premium line, that likely would be better.  Would I purchase again, no.  I have not tried other AE clothing products and not sure I would further.

  My wrinkle free non iron shirt arrived rolled up in a ball in a very small bag (see photo). Terrible packaging by amazon had to pay $5 for dry cleaning to get all the wrinkles out. So much for wrinkle free!!!!

  Very nice shirt. Given its low price, I was expecting only a reasonably made product, but the quality of the shirt actually exceeds my expectation. The colour of the real thing is darker than the picture and looks better in real thing.

  this is the regular size that I take but the body on these shirts was a little bit narrower than all my others<br>Also, it was not as wrinkle free as I had hoped and collar absorbs neck skin oil very quickly

  I AM USED TO BUYING SHIRTS BY LARGE XLARGE OR XXLARGE - FOUND IT VERY HARD TO BUY BY NECK SIZE TO HAD TO RETURN AS IT TURNED OUT TO ONLY A SMALL SIZE.

  Love it. I like that fact that I can choose a shorter sleeve. I wear medium size shirt from local store. Usually the sleeves are too long.

  Cotton is decent but not great by any means.  At the price point that this shirt sells at I give it a pass though

  Tailored well with stiffness around neck and wrists as expected.  fabric is very thin and translucent [see through].  Not a problem for me as I keep my coat on when visiting clients.
