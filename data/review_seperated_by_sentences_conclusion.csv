sentence,sentiment
"It's a pretty good, inexpensive casual or business casual shirt",1
Basic with few extras but pretty good,1
It fits as expected and is comfortable but there are some minor finish issues and it lacks what other shirts in this range have,2
"For example, it has no side pleats in back and doesn't have a box pleat below the yoke",0
It also doesn't have a hanging loop but I don't care about that,0
If you do you'll be disappointed,2
"So the back is a plain back which is not a problem for me but for some, who wear this to work and want a more finished look it may be an issue",0
If you're wearing it under a coat no problem of course but you'll have to take it off sometime :-D,0
The right cuff buttons are just a tad off so the cuff hem doesn't match exactly,2
This is only noticeable to me and only because I seem to have a habit of messing with them,0
So it isn't visible but can be felt,0
"Also, there are lots of loose threads from production that aren't removed so be ready to give the shirt a quick going over when you get it",2
"Most of them were simply loose pieces and pulled right out, but a couple of the buttons had to have the threads trimmed",2
Not a big deal,0
I'd give it 5 stars but for the few little issues I mention,2
Overall a solid shirt,1
pardon the pun,0
and a great standby for any traditional guy's closet,1
This is one of Van Heusen's better quality made shirts,1
"Although not completely iron free, if you wash and dry with a small load and remove from the dryer and hang immediately you won't require much ironing, none at all for those that wear these as casual shirts",0
I iron everything I wear,0
These are very well made shirts,1
Not thin or see through,0
But not hot and heavy either,0
"They look great with a sport coat and jeans, or as a dress shirt",1
For the price $22,0
"00, you simply can't beat these shirts",1
The colors are vivid,1
It's hard finding Striped Oxford shirts without paying at least $50,1
00 a pop or more,0
These are well worth every cent,1
I'd order more if they had more colors,1
Sizes are true in American sizing,0
So order your regular size without worrying about China's sizing,0
Great shirts,1
I have ordered quite a few of these shirts the past year,0
"So, I guess that the odds of me receiving one that was flawed was bound to happen",2
The issue is that I bought this shirt the end of February as a gift for my son in law,0
He did not wear the shirt right away because he was asked to work from home due to Covid19 the past ten weeks,0
Recently he wore the shirt and then washed it only to discover the unfinished seems at the cuff of each arm,0
It is past the time frame for me to return the shirt to the vender nor am I able to attempt the return,2
I would exchange this shirt if I could,2
Its disappointing,2
Darn Covid19,0
I have had a difficult time finding shirts that fit just right and are well constructed,1
I usually like Van Heusen and these shirts are no different,0
"The fit is great, neck size is good and sleeve length is great",1
"The material is a little on the heavy side, in a good way and all of the stitching feels durable",1
"I really like the collar on these, after buttoning them down they hold their shape well and look good with a sweater or jacket",1
"I have not worn them with a tie yet, but they do button snuggly but not too tightly",2
I originally bought one shirt to test it out,0
I have since bought two more in other colors so I can add them to my regular rotation,0
For the price I think these are fantastic,1
"I?셫 6???? 180lbs, fit",0
I purchased the blue 16,0
"5, 34/35 which fits me well, which includes the sleeve length",0
This my review:,0

RECOMMENDATION:,0
"Not the best shirt out there, the fabric feels so rough, it does not feel high quality",2
I don?셳 recommend it,2
I bought two shirts as a backup for when they would be needed for work,1
I wore the blue striped shirt twice,0
It's only been washed once,0
"The second time I wore it, I felt it split 3"" on the left side by the seem",0
It's a good looking and comfortable shirt,1
I just won't buy them again,2
I can't contact the buyer and return it because it's over a month since being bought,2
So much for planning ahead and having shirts ready when needed,0
I rarely dress up but am going to a relative's wedding where I'll have to wear a coat and tie to 2 different events,0
I'm more a jeans and flannel shirt guy,0
"I do have an older, but nice, blazer and needed to build a wardrobe around it",0
"Although I haven't worn it anywhere yet, but it fits great and looks good",1
I don't think I'll be embarrassing the family or myself,0
I also bought a light blue Van Heusen shirt for the alternate night,0
"Now, I just need to find a tie",0
"I needed a semi-dressy oxford cloth shirt that I could wear with a tie to church on Sunday, as well as without a tie for general ""business casual"" use",0
"I have had good luck with this brand in the past, and with Amazon's guarantees and ability to return if unsatisfied, I decided to give it a try",1
This is a VERY nice shirt,1
"Irons up very well, and it's well constructed to take a tie-- or NO tie",1
"The buttons are top quality, well sewn, and the fit was exactly as expected",1
I liked this shirt so much that after a month I just ordered a second one,1
Another quality Van Heusen dress shirt for my 'collection',1
"The collection starts at 16"" then 16",0
"5, then 17, then 17",0
"5, so I skipped 18 for this 18",0
They're too small to wear and too good to get rid of,2
I keep thinking one of these years I'll lose some weight,0
"These shirts are great, fit well",1
not too loose not too tight,0
and the best part is the sleeves really are 36-37,0
I always tell people I have monkey arms and it's so hard to get sleeves that are the correct size without getting Tall,0
not as common as it should be,0
or 2 XL which are then like wearing a tent,0
"These are perfect, just wish they were in a few more colors other than shades of blue",1
"I wore this shirt 1 time, then I washed it on a cold gentle cycle, delicate dryer both are large capacity, but I only washed 1 other shirt, and 2 pairs of pants and both cuff sleeves have completely fallen apart",2
The fabric literally shredded,2
Extremely poor construction,2
I should have realized it when threads wear coming off both sleeves the first time I wore it,2
I have added 3 pic's to show the shady workmanship,0
"I am not sure if I can get my money back, but I can prevent someone else from buying the terrible product, then I have done my job",2
Buyer BEWARE,2
I purchased two of these shirts and they wrinkle pretty bad compared to other shirts these days,2
I take them out of the dryer before it stops and hang them,0
Even doing this they are hard to iron to get all of the wrinkles out and after wearing for a little while they look like you have slept in them,2
"Nice material, good fit, nice style and such",1
just the wrinkling is my problem,0
And I am not expecting them to be wearable out of the dryer,2
I bought four of these shirts in different colors,0
They are fabulous,1
"The material seems high quality, they look great, and fit perfectly",1
"I'm on the small side, and trying to get dress shirts, much less sharp-looking dress shirts that fit is increasingly difficult",2
Ant to get these shirts at this price is near-unimaginable,1
"The sleeves are not 34"", but it is an ok shirt",0
Definitely runs small,2
I wouldn't recommend,2
I?셫 fairly gentle with my clothes and I?셶e never had anything like this happen before,0
"After first wash, cuffs became horribly frayed and mangled at the edges - had to end up cutting off several loose and frayed threads from both cuffs",2
"I usually roll up my sleeves and I might make a mending project out of it, but I shouldn?셳 have to",0
"For the record, care instructions say machine wash is fine",0
"I have a V shape and prefer button-down collar, tapered fit shirts",0
Getting difficult to find tailored fit button-down collar dress shirts that don't look cheap,2
Very pleased with look and feel,1
I wear a 15 1/2  32-33,0
Nice garment,1
I couldn?셳 wait to wear after its arrival,0
"However, it had a lot of loose threads",2
Staff that was assigned to ?쐁lean it??did a lousy job,0
I took care of it but it was a nuisance,2
Got a beautiful shirt  after that little trimming,0
The shirt is very nice,1
"Comfortable, fits well and  does not wrinkle",1
I ordered 34/35 sleeve length and it is the longest sleeve I?셶e ever owned,0
Have to roll up and cuff to wear otherwise I look like a pirate with billowing sleeves,0
Actual measurement is closer to 37,0
Useless as a work/office dress shirt unless you are Captain Jack Sparrow,2
Good fit at the neck/chest area,1
But would definitely consider getting the waist and sleeves tailored,2
"The quality of stitching isn't superb, but adequate",0
Especially considering the casual nature of the shirt,0
Van Heusen is consistently dependable,0
This shirt was what I was looking for,1
"It is dressy enough to wear with a tie and jacket, yet it also goes well with jeans",0
I definitely recommend it,1
Junk and paper thin shirt,2
I had to return two shirts as they had not been sewn at the edges of the sleeve cuff leaving a raw open fabric edge,2
They say easy care but they are heavily wrinkled straight out of the drier,2
Never buy again,2
The shirt comes out of the dryer looking pretty good,1
I always iron them but it is much easier with a shirt that already looks pretty good,2
The seams are straight and the fit is good,1
The seams on both sleeve cuffs came un-stitched with first laundering,2
The shirt is unusable,2
Update: Shirt replaced quickly with easy return of the original,0
"If this one holds up, I will update rating to 5 stars",0
"Very nice color, excellent fit",1
Good wearability and thank god it comes in many sizes,1
"I get compliments wearing these Van Heusen shirts, mainly because they fit",1
"Plus, THEY LOOK GREAT, and the collars are very sturdy and clean-looking",0
I love the way these fit,1
"My husband wore this shirt twice?봶ashed on cold gentle cycle, delicate dryer as all his work shirts are",0
The cuffs have completely fallen apart on both sleeves,2
Not just the stitching either?봳he fabric itself has literally shredded,2
Extremely poor construction,2
"This shirt is really nice looking, well made and wrinkle-free",1
"Really, wrinkle-free",1
So why doesn't Van Heusen make more like this? I don't know,1
I certainly would buy a few more in solid colors,1
"Now other Van Heusen shirts? Trashy, not wrinkle-free, not true to size and cheap looking although the same price",0
Go figure,1
Bought this for my husband to wear to our son?셲 rehearsal dinner,0
It looked very good with black dress pants and a tie,1
"The shirt is made out of a very nice material, very easy to press",1
"These fit as expected since you order by neck and sleeve size, it makes no sense to buy ones that are just s, m, lg, xl and expect a good fit",0
I noticed some threads loose on the left shoulder when I wore it the first time,2
I thought they were just loose threads that could be cut,2
Wore it a second time and went to cut the threads they are coming out in several places,2
Very dissapointed,2
This shirt waste of money,2
The shirt fit great but one of the seams ripped out after 6 months of little wear,2
I can?셳 recommend this shirt even though I have always had good luck with Van Heiden,1
"Brought these shirts for my husband, he has broad shoulders so it fitted well there but waist area was abit loose",0
Overall it was good,1
Not easy care or wrinkle free,2
Disappointed,2
My husband wore out his Van Heusen dress shirt - he liked the look and fit that much,1
"So glad we were able to order a new one online during our state's ""Stay At Home"" order",1
This shirt is great,1
Just as advertised and I am happy as I didn't have to wait in a line,1
"In fact, I'm ordering more",1
"I was happy to find the size, quality, and color needed",1
I bought this shirt for my husband to wear to semi-dressy events,0
"It would be good for others to wear at anytime, but he is a tee shirt kind of guy so I needed a comfy and easy care shirt",0
It fits well and I am happy,1
"got this for my husband and it fit true to size, and it was half the price from big name stores, which is even better",1
And it fit as we expected it too,1
And the color looks good on him,1
No complaints,0
Really like the shirt,1
It is a little snug through the chest and waist,0
These seem to run a bit smaller than my other brand dress shirts of the same size,0
Van Huesen had the best dress shoes,1
"great fabric, feel and amazing well made",1
My Husbands fave' ~ look great on him,1
PJ,0
I ordered this shirt because I have one just like it -exactly the same,1
Older one is 5 years old and still like new,0
Was replacing some others from other manufacturers with same stripe as collars started to wear from chin whiskers,0
"Oh, I do have many other shirts for all seasons blue pin striped are my casual favorites",2
"An inexpensive shirt, and you get what you pay for",1
"The fit is a little blousy, and the fabric a bit thin",0
"Getting hard to find these traditional striped shirts in a button down style, so this one fills a need, but I doubt it will stand up well to repeated laundering",2
"Still, the price was right",0
Husband wears these types of shirts to work,0
He likes them for their comfort,1
I like them because they don?셳 need ironing,1
Defective stitching on pocket,2
See photo,0
Returning shirt,0
A little larger than I thought it would fit,0
Other than that it is a nice shirt,1
Not super well made but for the price a good shirt,1
I received a lot of shirts at the same time and tried them on,0
This shirt was the same size but was a lot bigger,0
It will do but not satisfied with the size,2
Its not a heavy dress shirt,0
More light then heavy,0
happy with it,1
Better then expected for the price,1
"I find it very difficult to find good dress shirts with a 18 inch collar and 34-35 sleeve, but these exactly fit the bill",1
"They are good looking, wrinkle resistant shirts",1
Unfortunately i didn't try the shirt one right after i purchased it,0
This was a back up and its been way over a month since my purchase,2
When i put it on for the first time the sleeves and cuffs were too small,2
I couldn't button the cuffs,2
The left button on the collar fell off before the end of the day,2
"Make sure you try it on the same day you get it , even if it is a backup",0
Wrinkles bad,2
Unlike the same model but has pinpoint on the collar,0
This one comes out immediately from the dryer and requires it to be ironed,0
Not good,2
"Arrived on time, and they are a perfect fit for a paunchy old guy with a 17 1/2 inch neck size",1
I must say that I was pleasantly pleased with these purchases,1
Bought five at same size  and I am just please at the fit especially in neck and sleeves,1
Tailoring is nat bad either,0
It appears shirt manufactures are saving on material,2
tight in all the wrong places,2
Love it,1
Will buy another,1
A true taylored shirt,0
Would be A+ if it had a button down collar,0
Beautiful shirt,2
Nice fabric,1
Excellent fit &amp,1
quality,1
Washes nicely,0
No wrinkles,2
My Hubby loves these shirts,1
Easy wash &amp,1
dry with little or no ironing,0
Purchased this shirt for my husband and it?셲 a great quality shirt,1
I ordered a couple of these shirts online because I could not find my exact size locally,0
16 x 34/35,0
The fit is pretty good,1
Just on the loose side,0
a tad,0
"but maybe, after a wash, they'll be just right",0
The fabric is not super heavy,0
"but not see-through, either",2
I like the weight,1
"Overall, happy with the shirt",1
Basic dress shirt without all the frills,0
"This was exactly to fit, I wear it for work",0
I love it,1
Great material and doesn't shrink or fade after a few washes,1
"I wore this shirt 1 time, then I washed it and both cuff sleeves have completely fallen apart",2
The fabric literally shredded,2
Extremely poor quality,2
Please stay away from this,1
Waste of ?뮥,2
Great quality,1
Shirt was a perfect fit,1
Wore to compliment my wife?셲 dress for a night out event,1
Nice fit but a lot of loose threads hanging out all over the shirt,0
"After the second laundering, a buttonhole on the front frayed and is now essentially unusable",2
"Of course, I noticed this after the return date, so now face an expensive repair",2
Beware,0
"The quality and design of this dress shirt is extraordinary, especially given the cost",2
"Well done, Van Heusen",1
Seems very well made and fit exactly like it should,1
pretty  - nice material  fast shipping and well packed,1
This is a really nice looking shirt,1
Which I used to dress up,0
The shirt fit fine,1
My problem is the cuffs unraveled on the first time my husband wore it,2
Unfortunately it was past the date of making a return,2
Poor quality in sewing appears to be the cause,2
The seam did not fix the fabric it was supposed to hold,2
What a waste of money,2
Very nice shirt,1
Well made and very comfortable,1
An exceptionally competent shirt at a fair price,1
La mejor opci처n en camisas lindas y de f찼cil planchado es VAN HAUSEN,0
"Looks great, fits great and arrived quickly",1
Cannot find 18 neck with a size 30/32 shirt anywhere,0
This one fit my boyfriend perfectly,1
Quality shirt,1
Only issue was LOTS of loose threads,2
I had to check each seam with a pair of scissors in hand to clean up all the dangling threads,2
This shirt is too short,2
Not long enough,0
Wish to return,2
Please advise,0
Nice quality,1
Fits great,1
Husband really likes this shirt,1
Shirt was as described by seller,0
A few loose threads that had not been cut off which is not unusual for a shirt in this price range,2
overall very pleased,1
Fits just right,1
Will probably buy more in other colors and patterns,1
"Needed a tall, but the shirt is quality",1
Well-made shirt,1
Feels and looks like an expensive dress shirt,1
Took correct measurements of myself and it fit great,0
The fit was not at all as I expected,2
The sleeves were way too long and the shirt was very baggy all around,2
So I ordered a different size and it fit very  well,0
This shirt was bought to replace the same shirt bought 20 years ago,0
Looks and feels to be the same product,1
We'll let you know if this one lasts 20 years,0
Van  Heusen is a great brand,1
The fit is exactly right,1
Comfortable but Not long enough,0
Barely tucks in my pants,0
Love the shirt,1
I wish I could get some others in different patterns in my size,1
Good quality and one of the few items where I ordered what I normally wear and it came in just right,1
This shirt fit him perfectly and he loves it,1
These shirts were a great value but they come out of the dryer wrinkled,0
Shirt had a nice look and was a good value,1
Not a no-iron shirt,0
"A neat and hard to find color pattern, but be prepared to get the iron out",0
Straight from the dryer its wrinkled,2
Quality good,1
Fit good,1
Holds up washing,2
Would buy again,1
"I liked this shirt, fits good, quality built",1
"I Love this shirts, but as they are too small for my husbands neck, I am returning and ordering a larger size",0
They are truly beautiful,1
Material is not the greatest like Tommy Hilfiger shirts but it is right for the price,0
I was Very Pleased,1
", THANK YOU",0
poor fit buy a size or two up,2
Good fit,1
Need to add another button to the bottom of the shirt to help keep it straight when tucked in your pants,2
Awesome quality great value,1
"good fit, easy  to move in",1
Fit is a bit snug,0
Order up a size,0
"Shirt wears fine, unfortunately though after about the third dry cleaning the blue stripes are now bleeding into the white fabric",0
Same professional dry cleaners I?셶e used for decades and not had this happen to any other dress shirt or garment,2
"Disappointing to say the least, two months use and now into the trash",2
"I really love this shirt its fit perfectly, it is just perfect for me",1
Thanks a lot,0
"I like design,color,brandname",1
"Beautiful shirt, great colors, fits very well and the price is very good",1
"Van Huesen shirts have been around for a long time, there's a good reason",1
The feel of the fabric and the fit is not as expected,0
"With only wearing this a few times, the shirt should not have lose threads",2
"I should have returned it prior to the cut off time, but unfortunately I procrastinated",2
:-,0
Fits great,1
Just what I needed,1
I ordered 18,0
5/36 -37 tall,0
Shirt would be fine except the tail is too short,0
Quality fabric and fit,1
Quality not as expected,0

This brand used to be of better quality,1
Quality was good,1
Fits great,1
Good value,1
Not wrinkle free,0
Nice color on shirt,1
Fit was perfect,1
Material was a bit thin,0
Not the highest thread count either,0
A decent everyday shirt,0
Nice product,1
High quality,1
Reasonably priced,1
Purchased the shirt for my husband for work,0
One of the collar buttons was missing when it arrived,2
"Fortunately had an extra button and sewed it on, but disappointing that the shirt arrived with the button missing,",2
Looks great,1
Nice fit and feel,1
Good Shirt,1
Great quality but too long and loose around waist,0
Looks and fits great tucked in,1
Fits great,1
Excellent shirt,1
"Not bad but it is a bit loose , buy half a size smaller than your actual size , quality is good and very comfortable , packiging and delivery were excellent",0
Great Shirt,1
"Perfect shirt, perfect size and fit, reasonable cost, no hunting in store for right size and style",1
Exactly as show in photo,0
Like,1
Very poor quality have always bought Van Huesen maybe not anymore,2
WOULD WOULD BUY AGAIN,1
NICE SHIRT,1
"Excellent, Thanks, Michael, 2019",1
I have been buying Van Huesen shirts for a long time,0
They are good to wear,1
Very good quality and good price,1
Fits as expected,0
"Good feel, soft material, easy to iron and looks sharp",1
Really nice shirt,1
I got one but the size is completely not fitting for me,0
The shirt,0
"Opened the package, put the shirt in the wash, cuffs shredded",2
Poor stitching quality,2
I thought about reaching out to the manufacturer before posting a review but really they should do quality testing before they ship these things out,2
My wife is working on stitching up the cuffs,2
"Nice looking dress shirt, but needs to be ironed ?삎",0
size was exactly correct,0
shirt fits fine,1
"The blue stripes are quite clear, soft blue",1
Really did not like the way this fit,2
Much to big,2
It washes well and doesn't shrink at all,1
Still looks good after two washings,1
"I'm generally pretty happy with Van Heusen shirts, and this is no exception",1
Works with both dress pants and jeans,0
"If they ever come up with a shirt that irons itself, I'll bump the review up to five stars",0
Really like the color of this shirt,1
It's great,1
"Good fit, good material",1
"Fits well, very attractive, soft and comfortable material",1
Would buy again,1
Basic dress shirt that fits perfectly,1
Comfortable breathable material,1
Like the quality and variety of colors and print,1
Fits well and I like it,1
Product was satisfactory,1
Met my expectations,1
Thanks,1
Great shirt with a perfect fit,1
"A little too wide, it is a regular fit but still a little wide even for that",2
Great quality and look though,1
I love the shirt,1
It is comfortable and looks great with navy slacks,1
"I live in South Georgia, so it's definitely not a summer shirt",0
It fits as expected,0
"It fit as expected, but as a tall person it is a tad shorter than I want, but not so bad that it renders the shirt unwearable",0
Nice,1
would've given it 5 stars but the sleeve length was just a tad short,0
but acceptable,0
"If you are on-the-fence between sleeve length options, go with the longer sleeve",0
"Otherwise, fits well and looks good",1
Quality is not so good and strands of thread are coming out on many places of the shirt,2
It is not really easy care,2
It definitely needs ironing after washing and drying,2
I don?셳 consider that easy care,0
"Great shirt, great price, bought a second shirt",1
These are a great value,1
You could easily pay two or three times as much for a shirt of this quality,1
I am wearing one right now,0
Spend a bit more and get a good fit at others,2
"The Van Heusen  brand has obviously gone the way of what once were 1st class producers such as Bell and Howell, Arrow, etc",1
good product,1
I wore this shirt three times and the sleeve stitching completely unraveled,2
Poor quality,2
Good,1
"I have always like Van Heusen shirts, and have been buying them for many years",0
This particular shirt was on sale and probably because  it has issues,2
"After the very first wash the  cuffs came apart, it turned out to be a wear once shirt",2
"Fit is perfect, colors vibrant, and tailoring is very good",1
Quality and perfect size,1
"Fabric: soft, neck: just right",1
Great quality at a more than reasonable price,1
"Good price, authentic product",1
Love this line of shirts,1
have owned many,1
"This shirt wears well, and looks great when starched and pressed",1
has the appearance of a shirt costing much more,1
The collar size and arm lenth are correct,0
However it is wa to big around the abdominal area,2
Unless you are obese better to get slim fit,0
The headline is the review:,0
"Good quality, good fit, good appearance, good price, delivered promptly",1
Will buy more as the occasion merits,1
First of all they have different size criteria and had to actually have my brother measure his neck size,1
"After measuring it well, and choosing the closest size from this list, this is way too large to fit in",0
Satisfied customer,1
Decent shirt for the price,1
Fits just like every other shirt I own with the same measurements,0
"If I can find the same shirt in different patterns, I'll get a couple more",1
Great fit,1
He loved it,1
Love this brand and this shirt,1
nice shirt,1
Can't wear it,0
Perfect shirt for my body size,1
Great fit and crisp dress shirt,1
Loove,2
Nice shirt but I wish it really was a 16 1/2 x 33,0
The sleeves are way too long &amp,2
it looks like wind breaker on a windy day,0
Strudy material and you can't beat the price,2
"Finally  , nice",1
Good quality for casual Fridays,1
I like the way it fits and I like the way it looks,1
Received great compliments from friends,1

Perfect as I want,1
Van Heusen shirts just seem to fit great and look great,1
It's a well made shirt and I'm glad i got it for a very good price,1
Fit amazing but had a small whole on the sleeve,0
Great quality and stripes spacing and color suttle yet dressy,1
"Very well made, washes and wears well",1
"I've never had any problems with Van Heusen shirts, my favorite",1
"I opened one shirt-it is paper thin, very poor quality and about two sizes too small",2
What happened to Van Heusen?  I bought four of these and wasted my money,2
"The boxes were left out in pouring rain, instead of putting under the covered porch, so returning is not even possible",0
"love these shirts, excellent quatlity for the price",1

Perfect fit,1
Very nice looking shirt,1
Fit nicely too,1
It was too small,2
This was a gift and he loved it,1
A decent shirt for the money,0
Normally I?셫 pretty happy with Van Heusen /Amazon clothes but I just bought this shirt and there were over a dozen loose threads/strings that I had to cut off,1
Seems like a poor sewing job,2
Don?셳 waste your money,2
Bought this shirt for my husband and the cuffs frayed after the first wash,0
Returned it and got a replacement,2
Washed that one and the same thing happened even before wearing,0
Poor quality,2
"The shirt arrived bunched up in an envelope, torn",0
"The size 18 neck, 33/34 sleeve made it a Big and Tall, so had too much volume around the middle that I didn't need",0
Returned it for full credit from Amazon,0
Great,1
This shirt is exactly as pictured,0
It was true to size and is classic fit shirt,1
the quality is very good and durable,1
Has been washed several times and has not lost its color and did not shrink,1
Great shirt,1
Good quality product for the price,1
Would buy it again,1
Fits a big man well,0
Had the shirt laundered with extra starch it looked like the shirt you could buy,0
Great shirt and actually fit as expected,1

Well tailored and nice material,1
Coler was different than anything I had and very versitle,1
Nice pinpoint color,1

This item is complete garbage,2
My husband wore this shirt one time and the material on the inside of the neck is coming unstitched,2
He really liked the shirt but it is not made well,2
"Shirt is well made, and very comfortable",1
"The shirt fits perfectly, and is beautiful",1
The shirt was sewn with parts of the shirt's material on the wrong side,2
This is a very basic part of sewing to sew the garment with the material facing the same side,0
Good price,1
Nice shirt,1
I love the quality of this brand,1
As expected,0
Good product,1
Good quality,1

Nice Shirt,1
Wore it to church Sunday and was thinking of getting another one in a different color,1
Ok,0
Worked well,1
Nice shirt but the second button on the sleeve slit is stupid,0
Other than that this is my third button down Van Heusens shirt,0
Bought this shirt for my husband,0
The cornflower blue pinstripes are gorgeous,1
He looks so handsome in this and I think it's one of his new favorites,1
"It's also soft but ""manly""",0
An overall great buy,1
good fit and well made,1
It was used for work and church,0
I have been wearing these shirts for years at work each day,0

More like 10 stars,1
Smart shirt that you can withstand the daily grind in,1
Holds up wonderfully in the washer and dryer,1
Not a slim fit if that is what you are looking for,2
Great color and awesome fit,1
Must iron after wash but good material,0
Excellent fits perfect,1

nice shirt,1
"Good fit, good quality fabric, nice pattern",1
One star taken away for a poorly made buttonhole,2
One side of the hole has no stitches at all leading to loose threads,2
Did not bother to return it,2
Really nice shirt,1
Holds a pressing very well,1
Thinner material - would have liked to seen slightly heavier/denser material used,0
Collar is perfect for a point style,1
Stripes are very crisp but not overly bright,0
Sleeves are perfect length,1
Price is fair and I would buy it again,1
"Received in just two days, and I no longer visit department stores",0
still the best classic dress shirt made,1
Very nice shirt,1
I ordered the same size as always 17' neck / 33' sleeve,0
Sleeves are cut right,1
I cannot button the neck,2
May be mislabeled or a factory mistake,2
Returning is cost prohibitive,2
Nice made shirt though,1
I can wear it open collar with sport jacket,0
Great colour and fit,1
These shirts are very good and fit well,1
It is pretty sad that there are so few manufacturers who sell their shirts the old way: by neck size and sleeve length,2
Unfortunately we are not a S/M/L/XL society,0
Great purchase,1
"I'm 6'0, 195 and this shirt fits great even at 180",0
I've bought them for years at the outlet mall,0
when this particular size and color is in,0
They're a no brainer and I wear them to work,0
Looks great on my son,1
"Nice shirt, fit well",1
great,1
A little loose but after a few washes it should be just fine,1
GOOD,1
This appears to be a well made shirt but it is certainly not no-iron,2
Even taking it out of the dryer it is not wearable without ironing,2
I will send it to the commercial laundry from now on,2
I normally wear a 15 1/2 33-34 but of course they didnt have this size when I ordered,0
"So, I took a chance and ordered a 16 33-34 and it fit like a 15 1/2  Van Heusen is hit and miss that way sometimes",0
"Overall, its a decent shirt",1
Great looking Oxford Cloth dress shirt,1
like I used to wear 50+ years ago,0
Great fit and dignified simplicity for any well dressed man,1
Tall men need the extra arm length and this shirt provides,1
Sorry that this shirt is 65% polyester - 35% cotton,0
It is a hot shirt in the summer,0
The sleeves seems to be a bit long but not enough to request alteration or return,0
Shirt looks exactly like the picture and fits well,1
We have not had problems with wrinkles after several washings and the shirt is as vibrant as the day we bought it,1
"I am 6'1"", 255lbs",0
I re-ordered 16-16,0
"5, 36/37 and they fit great",0
I find that IZOD generally fits comfortably for bigger guys,0
like myself,0
I have not washed or had the shirt pressed yet,0
But so far so good,1
I washed this shirt for the first time and it was not wrinkle free,0
Another shirt from Van Heusen labeled easy care that I bought awhile ago came out of the dryer wrinkle free so my washing protocol was fine,2
Am very disappointed that this shirt does not hang up wrinkly free,2
Shirt looks good and at a better price then in stores,1
Very good,1
Stitching on one of the sleeves was irregular with lots of threads hanging out,2
Otherwise a great shirt,1
I always like to wear this kind of model  shirt,0
I feel very confortable and good looking when I used it,1
"This shirt is too large, I bought the smallest size and it looks like a XL",2
Too small and too tight based on other Van Heusen men's dress shirts that I have bought,2
great shirt fit right wrinkle free tough durable shirt would buy it again,1
Always depend on a perfect fit with Van Heusen,1
Great shirt,1
Returned,2

The shirt is too large for me and I give it to my father,2
And it fits,1
I purchased 2 Van Husen striped shirts from a department store and like most consumers reported,0
"After the first wash, the thread on the chest line began to come lose",2
"Now, it looks like the shirted has the stressed look",2
Not a Good look in Executive meetings,2
"My other shirt threads came out on the size, and the material simply tore",2
"Over owned 100s of Van Husen shirts, some wear out at the elbow, over had that a lot, but that's after 2 yrs and few washes",2
"The colors do not bleed, but the material gets very weak of regular office environment wear",2
I think Van Husen is officially off my purchase list,2
I ordered 3 of these shirts as they were on sale,0
Unfortunately I made the mistake of not washing just one to see what it looked like,2
They all look wrinkled no matter how you wash and dry them,2
Even my wife who is not that picky says they always look wrinkled,2
I'm not making a comparison with shirts taken to the cleaners but other shirts that are on the market,0
My advice is to buy a shirt from LL Bean and then one of these,2
I can guarantee that you will want to send this one back,2
"Sure the ones from bean are more expensive but they are much better quality, will last twice as long and yes are  actually wrinkle free",0
"If you want a shirt to leave untucked with jeans on casual day at work, yes you can get away with one of these",0
I gave them 2 stars because I've seen worse,2
"Very happy with the quality and shape of this shirt, but fit is a little tighter then normal, so I exchanged for 1/2 size",1
larger neck,2
"This is a nice shirt, pretty much just what I was looking for",1
My only suggestion is they be a little more precise on sleeve lengths,2
"An inch makes a difference so I would prefer a 34"" sleeve over a 35"" sleeve and over a 34/35"" sleeve",2
I like the shirt,1
"It fits perfectly, it's well tailored and made",1
It does not come out of the dryer wrinkle free but I've order a garment steamer to hopefully take the wrinkles out,2
"Other than that, I like it very much",1
"I bought it for my husband, and he loved it",1
This shirt is excellent as I expected,1
"The fit was just right, the material and price were excellent and I am completely satisfied",1
I'd like more of this in different colors,1
Sleeves too short,2
"Decent material, not great",0
When I washed the shirt the cuffs on the shirt fell apart,2
Bough this for my fiance,0
"He liked it very much in fit, feel, and color",1
Both cuffs in the shirt came apart with the first washing,0
The quality is horrible,2
Great quality just a little loose for my style,1
Slim fit would be perfect,1
Shirt sleeves are different lengths,2
I gave this to my father in law as a gift for Christmas and he just opened it,0
Apparently too late to return it deadline was 01/31 and it is now 02/04 - so now he is stuck with a useless shirt,2
very disappointing,2
"I haven't worn these business shirts much, so here's the main point: after being tailor measured, Van Heusen fit better than a competitor",2
"But at the time of purchase, there was a limited selection of colors and patterns by Van Heusen on Amazon",0
for this exact shirt style,0
Which is how I found a problem with fit from a competitor shirt maker,0
"I bought this shirt recently after receiving 2 other shirts in different colors for Christmas, to replace 3 other long sleeve shirts that are past their prime which I gave away to be used as art smocks",0
Very happy with the shirt I purchased plus,1
the two that were Christmas gifts,0
Quality shirt that had a comfortable feel and eye appealing look,1
Loved the color selection and felt the measurement guidance was helpful,1
The size I selected perfectly fit my build,1
I wear a 16,0
"5 36/37 and the shirt was a perfect fit, nice quality",1
Will buy additional colors,1
I husband loved this shirt,1
"It fit as expected, and at a good price",1
"Excellent material, good looking - and truly wrinkle-free",1
"Great, great value",1
Great shirt,1
like it a lot,1
"Great material, worth the price",1
Nice shirt,1
Me agrado fino,0
"Ok, so I'm short and stocky",2
let's get that out the way,2
These 18 1/2 x 32 shirts really fit me well,1
Love the way they feel and I wish they had all colors in stock so I could buy them all in my size,1
Comfortable fit and reasonable delivery,1
"This product looks fine and fits fine, althought the material is very thin",0
"However, after a few drycleanings",0
four or five wearings?,0
", the cuff completely opened up at the end",2
I can't see any signs of threads in there and it looks like a lot of the seams are just glued,2
"Oh well, the price was right",1
If my $200 shirts last 4 years maybe it's right that a $25 shirt lasts 4 months,0
I like this shirt,1
It has sleeves that are long enough for me,2
I wanted something in red because I already had enough blue shirts,0
It was exactly what I wanted,1
"It seems well-made, and should last a few years",1
I can now throw out or donate some other shirts that do not fit well or are worn out,2
"I got this shirt rolled up in a bag without any tags, pins etc",0
"Somebody else returned it, obviously someone smarter than I am I am not a big guy but I have a long torso and arms and all I want is shirts that fit",0
Doesn't sound that difficult but apparently it's impossible I ordered 5 shirts and one fit properly and it wasn't a Van Heusen so guess where I'm buying my next five shirts,0
This is a great looking shirt &amp,1
the size was dead on,0
I wash it with other whites &amp,0
when done hang it on a plastic hanger to almost air dry,0
I then put it in the dryer with a dryer sheet on medium setting for about 10 minutes &amp,0
it comes out dry &amp,0
without wrinkles,0
This shirt fits well is and is as expected as far as quality from Van Heusen,1
I have had many Van Heusen shirts over the years and this one was the same as all others,0
"good quality, good fit ans the sleeves are the length they say they are",1
I will definitely be buying other shirts like this on Amazon,2
"A partir de cierta talla deber챠a ser obvio que no soy delgado, nunca dijeron que fuera corte Slim",0
"Muy mal, no la regres챕 porque prefiero regalarla que seguir perdiendo el tiempo",0
I purchased this shirt and as I always do I wash it before use,0
When I went iron it I noticed a cut in the breast pocket that can?셳 be repaired,2
This was a defect in the shirt not caused by the washer,2
I would return for credit but the policy says in new condition,2
I have ordered many Van Heusen shirts in the past and no issue,0
"The shirt is very good as far as quality is concerned, I love the color",1
"As far as the size is concerned, I noticed that at the reverse of the wrapping plastic bag, there are three more additional sizes: Regular, Slim and Fitted",0
I do not understand why these additional sizes are not included in the on line description,2
"I could have had the option to decide what size would have been more addecuate to me, of course the regular fit is not the proper one",0
"La grande vari챕t챕 de ce mod챔le, sa disponibilit챕 en format pour moi, grandeur  cou et manches",0

Second brown stripe one and I have to send it back after one wash,2

"Excelente producto en su nivel, impecables acabados y tela de muy buena calidad",1
Muy recomendable,1
La entrega como siempre antes de lo prometido,0
This shirts fits comfortably and the price was right,1
"Perfect fit, not many long sleeve button shirts fit this nicely",1
Very good quality for the price,1
"Muy tersa y suave la tela, buena calidad, muy buen producto",0
En cuanto a la talla ya ten챠a otros productos de la marca y las medidas se mantienen uniformes,0
Quality is absolutely garbage,2
Wore the shirt and washed it four times and the cuffs are falling apart,2
Even when I received it brand new I looked at the quality and knew it wouldn't last long,2
Waste of money,2
Very good value,1
Highly recommended,1
Great shirt - feels good - appears to be great quality - Fits well,1
Fits well and the light pinstripe looks good,1
Nice for casual or dress,1

Comfortable fit,1
Good quality for the price,1
Thought it would be less wrinkled when it came out of dryer,2
labelled ad xxl but is actually xxxl,2
Weird fit,2
Can't fit around my neck but the shirt is enormous on me,2
"Me gusto mucho la camisa, igual a la mostrada, buena calidad en materiales y mejor precio",0

The shirts material is inferior for the money paid,2
Todo bien,0
good,1
I liked it,1
Value,1
Fit perfect,1
This is basically a good shirt,1
"Most of my shirts are Van Huesen, and I appreciate them",1
"However, ithis was advertised and described as a FLEX  collar, and the collar did not stretch nor flex",2
It had labels on it declaring that it was a Flex collar,0
"I have some Van Huesen shirts with flex flex collars, that have a built-in extendable collaf",0
They are good,1
This one did not stretch,2
Otherwise a good shirt,1
I think the supervisor of the guy over in Bangladesh,0
country of origin,0
"told him to put 275 of the ""FLEX COLLAR"" tags on by lunch time, and the worker, perhaps not being literate, worked hard to get them all affixed",1
This shirt replaced a similar Joseph Fees brand dress shirt,0
"I did have to iron it before the first wear, but since then it's been wash, dry, &amp",0
wear with no worries,1
"I wore this shirt to a job interview, and next thing I know I've moved 2000 miles and I'm making more money than I ever have",1
"Idk if that's the shirt's fault, but it certainly didn't hurt anything",0
This is the very first product review that I have ever written and I am 77 years old,0
"I bought two shirts, one white and one blue and they were delivered separately",0
The white one was in original packaging and was perfect,1
apparently by another supplier,0
The blue shirt is the issue,2
It was delivered in a loose package and it looked like someone had been sleeping in it for a week,2
It was completely wrinkled and out of its original packaging,2
My wife wanted me to return it or take it to the cleaners for pressing but I'm not interested in paying someone to do something that should not be needed,2
My wife agreed to iron the shirt so I hope the wrinkles come out but this is ridiculous,2
The sleeves are supposed to be 36-37 inches,2
Not even close,2
Plus the left sleeve is about 2 inches shorter than the right sleeve,2
The right sleeve is about 34 inches and the left is too short to even button,2
Not a good shirt,2
I returned the other shirt and will keep this because I need a dress shirt for a wedding,0
"But, it will be a one time wear and then junk it",2
"I have always liked Van Heusen shirts,",1
"As they fit well, look good too",1
"I particularly like this color, but that_ a personal",1
preference,1
I highly recommend the quality though,1
"Fits perfect, color and texture is great",1
"Is cut nicely, too",1
"For $22, I'd buy this shirt regularly",1
Some of the other colors were priced for a lot more but I won't spend any more for a shirt I wear to work when I can drive to the mall and spend $10 on the clearance rack for dress shirts,0
This is a decent shirt,1
but there are a few things of note about this shirt:,0
Pros:,1
The neck fit is nice with a little stretch,1
Wrinkle free is great,1
Cons:,2
The shirt came with a small black spot on it that doesn't seem to come out in the wash,2
"By ""regular fit"" they mean huge",0
Like really HUGE,0
"If you are not large person you should look for a ""slim fit"" or ""skinny fit""",0
"This is more of a ""regal fit"" in my opinion",0
"The wrinkle free shirt definitely needs to be ironed, but I expected that",0
The flex neck is very comfortable,1
The shirt fits true to size,1
I could probably use more of a tapered fit,0
I_ not a slim fit,0
", but I ordered the regular classic fit which has plenty of room",0
I ordered 4 shirts,0
I will order more like this if I can find other colors in my size,1
Please note: the first two I ordered from Macy_ were a nightmare,2
When they arrived,0
"the white one had two different size sleeves, as well as different style sleeves",0
I wrote a negative review on Macy_ site and returned it to Macy_ in person,2
The salesperson didn_ ask any questions and didn_ care when I told him the issue,2
I did not want them to resell the shirt,2
"18 neck, 32-33 sleeves",0
"So, I ordered 2 more through Amazon",0
"These two arrived together but one was not in it_ original packaging, and was a mess",2
It was scrunched up in a ball and stuffed in a plastic bag,2
I planned on washing/ironing them first anyway and was thankful they fit and had matching,1
correct,1
style sleeves,0
The issue I think was Christmas time shopping over loud  and I believe Van Heusen is going out of business,2
"The neck is to large, I measured against some other shirts I have and it is over an inch bigger",2
It is not a stretch neck as advertised,2
"The sleeves are short, they are 2 to 3 inches shorter than my other shirts with the same sleeve length",2
"I would send it back but I bought it for an event and I had to wear it, now it is going to Goodwill",2
Don't buy this shirt,2
Very comfortable with a nice fit,1
"The colors are bright and bold, which are perfect for me as an elementary teacher",1
"The only negative I've found is that Purple Haze is awfully close to Hearth, which I had ordered previously",2
I believe the camera flash has left it looking a bit brighter in the demo photo above than it actually appears in real life,0
"I was somewhat disappointed when I put it in my closet and noticed that they were very close shades of one another, with Hearth just having a tinge more red than Purple Haze",2
Looks great,1
packaged well,1
"But as it says the neck stretches or whatever, just know I used to wear a 17 1/2 and needed bigger so I got 18 and with the stretch feature I thought I'd be ok",0
But it still just barely fit,0
I can't imagine my neck went up 2 sizes so I wouldn't really take the stretch part to the bank,0
If you think you need a specific size get that or maybe 1/2 bigger,0
The shirt is the same cut as the shirts I_e bought from the brick and mirror store,0
However the _lassic pink is more lavender than pink,0
"I included a picture of what it looks like compared to my husbands actual pink and purple shirts and as you can tell, it_ light purple",0
"It_ fine, I_l keep the shirt, it_ just annoying since I was trying to replace a pink shirt",2
"In a dress shirt, it's all about the collar",0
"Fabric or prints are always overshadowed by either a sad, weak collar that won't standup or like this shirt, a stiff, vertical collar that stands up to a distinctive profile",0
Plenty of room in my 44 inch mid section and 50 inch chest,0
Ordered longer arms because I am heavier in my upper back and the length is roomy by 1 inch but I expect shrinkage by 1/2 inch,0
Great fit,1
"Compre una camisa Van Heusen, recib챠 algo que no tiene marca no se exactamente que talla es, no es el producto que solicite, decepcionado de la compra pero sobre todo decepcionado de Amazon de no validar la calidad de los productos que ofrecen",0
This is advertised as a new product but it had already been unpacked and had a stain where a pin was reinserted,2
I_e never had a problem with the other van Huesen shirts I_e bought on amazon,0
Over the years I have had difficulty finding a dress or sport shirt that fits me,0
"I have short, strong arms, a full, strong torso, and full muscular, short neck",0
This is a great shirt and I will be ordering more not that I know the fit and quality of fabric,1
Thanks,1
The size is not mentioned so until it arrive all you have is neck and arm length,2
Showing it is a 2x is far more descriptive to know if it will fit,0
I can only wear a 3X or larger,0
Nice material,1
Collar and sleeves fit exactly as expected,1
Body fits OK but could be a little roomier for me,0
"48"" chest, 44"" waist",0
"Not a lot of stretch, but a little",0
Size 17 neck 36/37 sleeve,0
"Soft, wrinkle resistant shirt that fit as required",1
I would recommend this product,1
I probably won't wear this too often because I don't see myself wearing a white dress shirt too often,0
When the next need arises I know this shirt will look good,1
It fit just as described and it looks great,1
You will not be disappointed,1
"Material is good thickness, not too thin like some shirts",1
Breathes ok,1
"this particular material holds hair, lint and dust pretty bad however",2
This is the only color that has done that out of the 4 or 5 shirts i bought from this group,0
The other colors have been ok,1
I bought this for my son,0
"The shirt is very nice quality, good fit and a great color",1
"The price was good, too",1
I would not hesitate to buy it again in another color for him,1
"This shirt is not well made or QC, it looks like they sew the QC label with washing label hence no QC the sewing machine treads on the collar are not uniform, a lot of treads hanging from the collars",2
This button down/dress shirt is very poor quality,2
My brother loves the shirt and it looks so great on him,1
Very well made and easy to wash and dry,1
Limited wrinkles which is awesome,1
Highly recommend,1
the collar does not flex as described,2
I have always got the shirts with expandable buttons but this is not the same,0
It fits ok but these are price point dress shirts for once in a while,0
Same shirts you can get at JC Penny,0
"Finding a black shirt for semi-casual wear seemed like a real task, but Amazon was there once again when the need arose",0
"Looks good, feels great and is much appreciated",1
"Husband needed a couple new work shirts, he found this one &amp",0
he loves the color &amp,1
it fits well,1
Exactly what he needed,1
"The collar on the shirt which was shipped was far too small for my neck, even though I ordered the collar that my neck measures at",2
"Perhaps if they had shipped the correct size shirt, I would be able to have a more favorable opinion",2
Had to iron this shirt so that was a disappointment,2
It food great and is comfortable,1
A different colored shirt that I got last year was made in Indonesia and it fit good,1
"I wanted to get another one in gray, but they were out last year",0
This year's shirt supply is made poorly in Ethiopia and didn't fit well,2
"The button holes and the buttons did not line up properly, so there was a bulge of extra fabric at the top below the collar",2
This is not acceptable,2
Good fit except too big on the arms,0
this white color is Flimsy than the other colored shirts i ordered otherwise still a good buy for the sale price,2
need a t shirt under this otherwise very nice shirt,0
we are pleased,1
These shirts were a great value for our groomsmen,1
They did layer with a solid white tee underneath but overall great fit,0
Very impressed with shirt,1
The fabric is soft and looks very dressy,1
My husband especially liked the collar,1
He said it was very comfortable,1
Just a tad on the large side but could not find a shirt to fit perfectly,0
"Great dress shirt, reasonable price",1
The fit was spot on w/ a little flex just in case,0
These shirts have no more give in the neck than any other dress shirt I_e worn in the past,0
That said the shirts fit fine and look nice,1
However if you want a little more stretch in the collar look elsewhere,2
Liked the color of shirt as pictured and fit extremely well--correct sizing as advertised,1
Nice shirt but the fabric is very thin,0
Thinner than previous purchase of the same,0
Except for that it is a nice shirt good quality,1
Very comfortable,1
Good Looking,1
Good Value for the money,1
Designer shirt for super cheap,1
Looks and fits,1
"This was a gift for my husband, he really liked the color and the fit",1
"These address nice shirts, but they still won't cover your big belly",0
They also do not come out of the dryer ready to wear,2
Perfect fit,1
Arrived early and seems _aylor fit,1
$55 retail price tag,0
Great deal _,1
"Would  buy again ,,,",1
Very happy,1
"The description stated DRESS SHIRT, LONG SLEEVE",0
It even stated the cuffs were adjustable,0
Guess what??? SHORT SLEEVE,0
Very disappointing,2
Who wears a short sleeve for dress? Honestly,0
__,0
not a comfortable material nor wrinkle free,2
Great looking shirt,1
My husband loves it,1

Material is fabulous and feels great,1
Very nice shirt,1
Super happy about the purchase,1
"easy order and fast delivery,  shirt fits great",1
I would not recommend this shirt to any one absolutely trash,2
Fits to big when you tuck it and after one wash Material wears out,0
"Great fit, deep rich color",1
the shirt fit excellently,1
"However, it is a scientific breakthrough this company is able to produce a material as thin as this shirt",0
I was shocked at how see through this shirt was,0
"Excellent material, fits in all the right places",1
Look good,1
Nice shirt,1
Very good,1
This shirt fit fine it wasn't a tailored fit so it provided me with a nice fit that was comfortable,1
Less wrinkles if you hanger it damp and not put it in the drier,0
"Wore this in a wedding as a groomsmen, and it was perfect for the occasion",1
Nice,1
"Good quality shirt for an excellent price, could be a bit longer but it was good enough",1
I needed a shirt with longer sleeves and this one fit me well,1

My husband loves the shirt,1
The color was perfect for our son_ wedding,1
"It was fine for the money, but it's not awesome",0
"Good quality shirt, as advertised",1
You know for sure what you're getting from them,0
I'm very happy with these shirts,1
"I'm hard to fit, and the separate sizes for sleeve, neck and length make it much easier to find a shirt that fits everywhere",1
Nice comfortable fabric too,1
I'll probably order some more,1
It_ perfect,1
The color was just like the picture too,1
"Good price, better than Belk's price with discounts and coupons",1
I pulled this out of the bag and there was a stain,2
It almost looked like makeup,0
Really kind of gross,2
Probably will be returning it/finding a different seller,2
Contacting customer service now,0
Fits as expected,1
True to size,1

But my necks not that big,0
Not as happy as I was in the 90's,0
"Excellent fit, excellent quality",1
Great value for an odd size,0
The collar does not stretch at all,2
This is false advertising and I am returning it,2
This shirt is so see through that you can see my son's skin and nipples through the fabric,2
Pretty much a waste of money as it will no be acceptable for an orchestra concert,2
"Great for, good fabric",1
I love this shirt,1
As expected,0

Perfect for any job or just going out,1

The comfort and flexibility of the shirt amazing product,1

Mostly too short,2
Fit great,1
"A mi esposo le quedo muy bien, es comoda , fresca y elwgante",0
It was a great purchase,1

This is a nice white shirt for dress or professional wear,1
"And it has a chest pocket, which is a feature that is rapidly disappearing in men_ shirts",0
"It does not have a placket down the front of the shirt where the buttonholes are located, which to us makes this shirt look a little more casual",0
The fit is _s expected,1
"My husband_ neck is between a 15 쩍 and a 16, and he found the size 15 쩍 a bit snug but wearable",0
"The fit is neither slim, nor baggy",0
"in other words, _egular is appropriate",0
The fabric is a bit lighter than the shirts my husband usually wears,0
He prefers a somewhat heavier fabric,0
I liked the weight of this one,1
Then comes the acid test: the laundering,0
"Coincidentally I washed this shirt with a white oxford-cloth dress shirt, a fabric that is my usual gold standard for wrinkle-free performance",0
The Van Heusen was ALMOST as wrinkle-free as the oxford cloth,0
"It would certainly be fine under a jacket and would do for regular office wear, but I think a touch-up ironing would be in order if the wearer wanted to make an especially good impression",0
Fit as expected in neck and sleeves,1
"I will add this caution to gentlemen out there who want to buy dress shirts online without trying them on, make sure to measure your neck and arms",0
"Especially if you have a shirt size in mind, but haven_ worn a dress shirt in a few years",0
"Or go to a department store and try some on, then come back to Amazon and save some money",0
Back to the shirt,0
"Very nice, high end look",1
"No shirt is truly wrinkle free, but this fabric once ironed should stay pretty crisp if you make sure to hang it when you_e done",0
The one thing I wasn_ quite sure on was the _tretch advertised,0
"I thought a stretch neck, or fabric with a little more give would be a great feature for a formal dress shirt, but I grabbed a handful of fabric and tugged, in both the neck and body of the shirt, there was no give at all",0
Just standard fabric,0
"Doesn_ detract at all from the quality or attractiveness of the shirt, just confused me a little because of the stretch advertised in the labeling",0
"Either way this is a very sharp shirt you can wear with a tie to dress it up, or a few buttons down without the tie, maybe even untucked if you wish",0
Still looks good either way,1
"It_ nice and light, as well as breathable which is something we can all appreciate when the temperature rises, or when you find yourself at a stuffy event",1
"Overall good fit, good packaging, hit it with an iron or steamer for a few minutes, toss on a tie and you_e ready to go",1
It will have you looking sharp in no time,0
"I was surprised to see this shirt was made in in Ethiopia, first time I ever had anything made there",0
The quality is standard Van Heusen,0
"I didn_ find anything particularly stretchy in the collar, it did have some give, but don_ expect it to stretch like women_ leggings",0
"I found the lighter patches along the tops of the shoulders a bit distracting, but the look is plainly evident in the listing pics  check out the pics of the models back",0
My 16,0
5 neck/34-35 sleeves were perfectly sized,0
"It_ a regular fit, but for me it fit close to that of a fitted shirt, this one was not at all boxy",0
"I wish they would stop using pins in the packaging, other than that the shirt did not disappoint",2
This is a great shirt,1
It's made with an ultra soft material that is lightweight and comfortable to wear on hot or cold days,1
It looks good with a suit and under a jacket as well,1
It washes well and only needs a light ironing,1
It's a vivid white and there are no flaws that I can find,1
4 stars,1
*If this review helped you make an informed choice about this product in any way I would appreciate it if you take a moment of your time and let me know by hitting the Helpful button and letting me know,0
"I appreciate that you took the time to read my review, Thank you",0
You can never have enough white shirts so I picked this one up for my husband,1
He_ 5,0
10 and about 210 lbs the fit is perfect on him,0
It is on the thinner side and needed  a t shirt underneath but other than that it_ a nicely made shirt with good quality,0
He looks so handsome in it with his black suit on,1
"I washed it on the delicate cycle, and low setting for the dryer took it out as soon as it done and no ironing was needed",0
I'm always excited to try out a new Van Heusen,1
"This regular fit is indeed regular - not too athletic anywhere and can handle a little bit of ""gut""",0
"Finishes, seams, touch and feel, color - all up to par with this brands track record - good plus",0
I don't really notice the stretch collar feature unless I try stretching it by hand - but it certainly doesn't hurt,0
I got the 32''-33'' sleeve - a little short for me at 6' tall,0
This shirt handled the first round of laundry perfectly,0
Strong buy recommendation,1
For $20,0
at time of review,0
", this is a really nice dress shirt",1
The color is saturated and the material is comfortable and nice without looking cheap,1
Fit as expected,1
Perfect work or church staple,1
The flex fit is more comfortable for my husband than the more structured shirts,0
"Would recommend, especially for the price",1
"In my experience, this brand holds up to washing really well",1
This is the size my husband wears in dress shirts and this shirt matched his body type to the T,0
5 8 165,0
It wasn_ too loose or too tight,0
The stitching around the cuffs and buttons were well stitched,1
The material is soft almost silky in texture,1
The collar  and color is just as advertised in the picture,1
These are excellent modern versions of a classic men's dress shirt,1
"Sizing is as expected, which is of course par for the course for a venerable brand like Van Heusen",1
Flex feature improves comfort,1
"Can be washed and cared for at home, but looks best when professionally cleaned and pressed",1
"Van Heusen makes a good shirt, and I've owned them and Arrow for many years",1
"This shirt is a continuation of the line, well made, good value, comfortable, full cut",1
"It's nice enough to wear with a suit, or for a more casual look without a tie",1
"You get classic looks, quality and price",1
A good value,1
Other shirts I've bought have shrunk when dry cleaned making them very difficult to button the top button to wear a tie,0
So far these shirts have not shrunken significantly,0
Hope that continues,0
My only issue with this shirt is the material it's made of,2
I just don't like this stretchy blend of cotton and polyester,2
It's thin and doesn't feel natural,2
I would pick a 100% cotton shirt over this one any day,0
Great shirt with comfortable and perfect fit,1
Great material that looks amazing,1
I don_ own many dress shirts and though this was free I now want to go purchase more options,0
"This shirt feels to be of the cheapest material, and does not feel at all like ""stretch"" material",2
The shirt is also SEE THROUGH in white,0
"Meaning, you can actually see your skin through it",0
Not a quality dress shirt,2
"Fits as expected, workmanship seems to be good",1
"Material is good, smooth and not flimsy",1
Buttons are tight,2
Great quality comfortable material with a stretchy neck,1
It fit as expected and I found no visible defects,1
"Fit like it was made for me, true to size",1
The packaging was very nice,1
I would highly recommend,1
"The dress shirt is good, especially for the price",1
The only thing is that the material its very thin,0
Bought this for my husband,0
It fits well and he likes that the neck expands just a little making wearing a tie more comfortable,1
As pictured,1
"the shirt that showed was mislabeled, was way to small",2
Shirt arrived open and had been either tried on or worn,2
Can_ believe it was such a mess,2
"Very comfortable, good finish",1
Fits very nice,1
I have ordered 2 Blue frost shirts and both had different flaws,2
The first one the top button was not aligned properly and the second one the cuffs was cut way to small,2
I wear Van Heusen shirts all the time specifically this style and i have never had any issues like this,2
The fabric just didnt seem right to me either,2
I question the sellers product legitimacy,2
Purchased for my husband to wear to work at a large box store,0
He has wide shoulders and long arms and he said the future was perfect and the shirts give him great range of motion for work and they are very comfortable,1
Very nice shirt,1
Very comfortable,1
Very stylish,1
"The color is nice, totally subjective I know but I like it, fit and finish are very good",1
"It appears so be fairly sturdy, I like to roll my sleeves up to the elbow and every now and then my bony elbows will rip the sleeve open if it doesn't ride up when I bend my arm",0
With this Van Heusen Dress shirt so far so good,1
"Each time I've worn this one, recently, we've had 90 degree plus days, yet I don't feel uncomfortable wear and working in, it is not sticking too me unlike some shirts",1
"The collar is a good fit for me, that is a big deal for me as it is hard to find a shirt that has long enough arms, a good chest size and not too tight or too loose in the neck",1
Most off the shelf shirts that fit elsewhere try to strangle me or make me look as though I have lost too much weight too quickly,0
"Bottom line, I like this shirt",1
It is amazing how much a little stretch material in a dress shirt to make it much more comfortable,1
"I found that the cut of the shirt was perfect, it has a tailored fit",1
But still enough room in the collar,0
"I_ 5 6, 165 and wearing a size 15",0
I also like how it is styled,1
"Clean white, fabric doesn_ seem to hold stains, and the collar lays nicely",1
this shirt is awesome,1
the money I well spent the quality amazing  it feels very comfortable it moves with you the flex material great I'm ordering another shirt right at this moment thank you,1
"I ordered 17"" Neck 32""-33"" Sleeve",0
X-Large,0
Quality is good and fitting is perfect,1
I usually have hard time finding correct sleeve size,0
I will be ordering few more,1
I purchased this as a gift and he loved it,1
It fit perfectly and true to size,1
"Good quality he said, so I am happy if he is happy",1
I was sceptical about getting the shirts but now I have three we really like them,1
Excelente calidad estoy muy satisfecho,0
Muy buena camisa para el trabajo,0
good product,1
Dear Potential Buyers,0
before you buy I would like you to know a few facts about this product,0
The color is cream - close to ivory,0
"it is not white, in fact it is far from white",0
If you have a high performance job,0
"a waiter,  a barman or you spend some  hours in office wearing the  suit",0
", than you will feel like wearing a plastic bag - wet and uncomfortable with strong sensation of aching",2
The information,0
on website and on shirt's  label indicates that it is 100% cotton,0
It is not,2
"It is 100% polyester, uncomfortable to use",2
"This shirt,  20-30 minutes after ironing, will lose it shape, and you will look like a rickshaw  driver after very long rainy day",2
"The price for 100% polyester shirts is usually 70% cheaper  than cotton, because difficult to wear in cold or hot days",2
"From the ethical point, looks like ""Amazon"" is taking very  strange business direction, by selling polyester as a cotton",2
"It is not ""Essential"" it is ""Strategic Mistake""",2
I returned the item,2
Not acceptable,2
I purchased a 16??32-33??French Blue shirt,0
"Very much liked the color, the fabric, the fit when I first tried it on",1
It washed up nicely,1
I liked it so much that I anticipated buying two to three more,1
"So, what?s the problem?  Well, when I put it on and with my hands at my side everything is great, however if I move my arms or do almost anything, the sleeves become 1-3 inches too short and I must return my hands to my sides and pull the sleeves back down",2
It seems like the shirt is just too small across the back,2
I'm really happy I decided to order one of these shirts,1
"I was looking to buy a red/blue tattersall and when I saw this, I figured it was worth a shot",1
"I typically wear Brooks Brothers non-iron shirts, and while these aren't the same quality, they are definitely comparable to brands such as Calvin Klein",1
"For the money, it is a fantastic value and I would have given it 5 stars had it not run pretty small",1
"This is marketed as a 'regular fit', and while I am certainly a large guy",0
6'3 250,0
", I expect a regular fit shirt to be relatively loose fitting given the measurements I buy",0
17,0
"5, 35",0
"This will not fit you if you are, sorry, very overweight or obese",0
"I am going to order a 18"" neck next time and see how it fits",0
I bought this dress shirt from Amazon Basics and another dress shirt of the same size / color Kirkland brand from Costco as a test for which $20 men's long sleeve dress shirt is better,0
Costco wins,2
Comfortably,0
The Amazon Basics shirt looks thinner and cheaper,1
It's fabric is a bit stiffer and less comfortable,2
"Either the sleeves are a bit shorter for the listed size, or the shirt shrank -- neither of those options is good",2
"Lint and fuzz cling to the Amazon shirt more, even though I washed it and the Costco shirt at the same time",2
"Overall, it's not an awful shirt, but if you've got access to a Costco, the choice for a $20 men's dress shirt is easy, and it's not Amazon Basics",2
These dress shirts are great,1
"They are a nice white, fit well and awesome price",1
Can?t beat 20 bucks for a dress shirt anywhere else,1
"I first got this size shirt in the slim fit but was a little too tight for me, wanted more maneuverability of my arms",2
some people might like that tight though,1
So returned it no problem and got the regular fit and couldn?t be happier,1
Absolutely love it,1
Must buy,1
Oh and it really is non-iron,1
Comes out of wash great,1
This shirt surpassed my expectations for this price point,1
I have been ordering another brand from Amazon and the quality of the Amazon Essentials shirt is so much better and the fit is better,1
"For all my dress shirts, this is going to be the shirt I buy",1
"When I lose a little weight, I will be buying Amazon Essential pants also",1
Everything I have bought from Amazon Essentials so far has been excellent quality at an affordable price,1
I'm hooked,1
I bought this for my husband after I ran one of his white shirts in a colored wash and it came out gray,0
He put this on as soon as I have it to him and really loves it,1
I did notice that it is a bit see-through,2
But he doesn't mind that his undershirt shows through,1
This is a very well constructed shirt for the average size man,1
"highly recommend, ",1
but if you are a BIG size man then this is not the shirt for you,2
It is way to small in the stomach,2
The sleeves and neck size are fantastic,1
Fantastic price,1
This is the first time I have been disappointed by Amazon Essentials and I have bought several other items - which were all good,2
The fabric used for this shirt is just not right,2
The label says cotton but I have my doubts,2
Too shiny and doesn't feel right,2
"Super grabbed lint, etc",2
Reminds me of a gangster shirt,2
Someone at Amazon Essentials dropped the ball,2
I will never wear this shirt,2
"Sorry, Amazon, but this is bad",2
"Way undersized, bought a Van Heusen shirt with this one, exact same neck and sleeve measurements",2
"The Van Huesen shirt fit fine, this one I could not even button",2
I give it one star as the fabric was bright and colorfull,2
"I got the Van Heusn, a Steve Land, and 2 AMazon shirts",0
"Steve Land was 10$ more than others Van Husen was 23, Amazon was $20",0
Steve Land was the best as the black was a real black,0
Fit was great and so was the fabric 100% cotton,0
"THIN, but I wear a black undershirt",0
Still thin,0
Amazon Essential 2nd best,1
"NOT the Solid Poplin, this was wrongly sized",2
", as it is almost a black indigo",2
"You cant tell unless you hold it up with a actual black shirt or if you are matching black pants, it can be a issue in day time",2
"Also it is 100% cotton, fit is a bit snug on chest , BUT it may get worse with washing",2
"I also purchased a 2nd Amazon shirt which fit great and the fabric was not see through, and it was more a casual threading as it has a micro wrinkle look vs a candle wax like dress shirt look",1
"This is a great shirt also, yet suffers the dye ink of the indigo black, and not a true black",2
Still I am keeping these and returning the VanHusen,1
"I was never a fan of them, and now I know why a few discerning others felt the same",2
:-,0
"This shirt is the Wrinkle resistant, regular fit, and besides the size measures it shows a L/XL/XXL indication",0
"The ""Poplin essential"" does not show that and the midsection stomach area runs rather tight for a 37"" sleeve with 18""neck",2
The midsection was a tight 46,0
"I love the quality of this shirt, the fitting, and the price",1
This shirt outshines the $60,1
0,0
men's warehouse,0
shirts I usually buy in terms of all of the above,0
"Not to knock my other shirts, because I still love them as well but I am definitely buying these from now on",1
"I am 5'7"" and 180#, a little on the chunky side",0
I used to lift weights so my chest,0
I dont know the size,0
"is a little bigger, not in the way I would like-so a nice, good looking fit is sometimes difficult to achieve, but this shirt manages to make me feel comfortable and make me look nice and fitted",1
This review is based on wearing the shirt once all day,0
I ordered an 18 1/2 neck 34-35 sleeve length,0
I am 6 feet 250 LBS,0
I am pleasantly surprised that the shirt fit perfectly and irons easily,1
It did not feel like I was wearing a piece of linen--it did not become wrinkly even after wearing it all day,1
The fabric kept it's shape all day like the comparable premium store bought brand,1
Note that this shirt is a classic fit with the traditional fabric,1
not the stretch-flex kind,1
"I cannot vouch for it's durability over time but for the price, I will come back to buy another",1
These were a replacement because I couldn't find the shirt I purchased prior,0
It appears Amazon replaced a prior shirt with this version,0
In any case I bought these for my boyfriend and the material is definitely a lower quality,2
Not nearly as soft and the neck chafes him so badly that he can't wear these shirts,2
you'll also want to be sure not to wash it with anything else because it picks up everything else in the washer and dryer,2
It's a shame really because the shirt itself fits perfectly fine,1
Disappointed and searching again,2
I just got this a few days ago and washed it,0
It fits well,1
The only issue I have is that the collar stays can come out in the washing machine/dryer and get lost,2
"over the past years, I have only bought shirts that have collar stays sewn in so they don?t get lost",0
"I basically drilled two small holes in the stays and sewed them into the collar, and they now stay in",0
"At this price, And otherwise good quality, I am happy to buy more and see the collar stays in the other shirts also",1
I was looking for a full cut shirt that could be worn untucked,0
I ordered 15,0
5X32-33,0
These shirts are very nice but the cut is too snug for me,2
"Also, the sleeves were definitely 32 and not 33",2
"I'm 5'10"" and weigh 170",0
I ordered this shirt and it ripped in the area pictured after a few wears,2
There was no excessive use or wear at that point in my opinion so I submitted a return,0
Amazon graciously offered me a new shirt,1
"I was supposed to return the other one, and didn?t so I ended up being charged for both",0
That?s fine because it was my fault for not returning the shirt,0
But now the second shirt has also ripped in a similar fashion,2
the one pictured,0
Just a heads up that these shirts appear to have a flaw,2
"Brand new, the cut seems as nice as high quality",1
"brands, and the fabric seems to be higher quality,",1
also,0
I bought two of these shirts because I needed the 16 1/2 neck size,0
I really like how easy it is to button the neck button because I had a mild stroke five years ago that affected my left hand a bit,1
The fit is perfect and the quality is first class,1
"Being retired I don't wear a dress shirt that often, but when I do  I don't want to have to fight to get dressed",1
Buy this shirt,1
You won't be disappointed,1
Have been buying Amazon essentials white shirts for a while,0
Recently started noticing that the shirt buttons are cracking or cracked,2
Also noticing that the quality of the shirts does not stand up to dry cleaners,2
Don't know how many shirts I have offhand but I am going to stop buying for a while,2
Too bad,2
"With regard to material, these amazon 100% cotton shirts are not as high-quality as ""designer"" 100% cotton shirts like you could buy in department stores",2
"The problem is it's hard to find 100% cotton shirts in the department stores these days, at least out my way",0
"The shirt fits well--not that ""slim fit"" for guys that eat one lettuce leaf a day",1
"For the price, it's a very good shirt",1
"Shirt looks fantastic, and the collar is great for collar stays",1
Very good looking shirt and I am very pleased with it,1
Can use either casual or fully dressed up with a suit and tie,1
These shirts fit great and look very sharp,1
My only complaint is that the collars fabric is very rough,2
Wearing this shirt all day is impossible for me since it makes my neck feel raw,2
I solved this by buying a piece of disposable stick on fabric that serves as a collar protector,2
It?s the only way I can wear these shirts comfortably,2
Needed a white shirt for my husband to wear to our sons wedding,0
He has several expensive shirts that didn?t fit at the neck,0
He was uncooperative in going to the store to buy one so I tried Amazon because of the quick shipping,0
Great fit,1
Looked great and no one knew it was inexpensive,1
Thanks,1
You get what you pay for with this shirt,1
"The fabric is very thin and the sleeves are too short, particularly when you bend your arms",2
"I was disappointed as I really like the Amazon polo t-shirts for warmer months, but I won't be buying any more of these",2
I normally where a 17??but ordered a 17 1/2,0
Collee was great but chest and waste was tight,2
Suppose to be regular fit ???,0
Sizing okay,1
Style? Not so much,2
Picture makes it seem like small squares pattern,0
reality is fairly large ?plaid??- highly unflattering unless you?re a bean pole,0
So these shirts are supposed to be 100% cotton,0
The material is beyond stiff that it actually left scratch marks in my biceps,2
Fits fine but definitely not breathable nor comforrable to wear,2
This shirt is really nice,1
I wasn?t sure at first when I purchased it because it was an Amazon branded shirt but it?s one of my favorites,1
I have to wear a dress shirt to work everyday and hate to spend a lot of money on them so the price right on this one so I gave it a chance,0
"It looks great, fits great and comes out of the dryer without wrinkles",1
Great shirt,1
"I was looking for a pink shirt to add to the single pink shirt that I have, and I clicked on a the color that I wanted",0
"However, when the shirt was delivered, the color was not the shade that I ordered",2
it was almost white,2
"I seldom return items, and did not return this shirt",0
I will simply use it as one of my white shirts,0
Lovely satin like fabric,1
Looking forward to buying more shirts from this brand,1
Only wish they were not so wasteful with the packaging,2
There are plastic inserts AND cardboard just to prop up the collar,2
The metal pins are also quite unnecessary,2
A great dress shirt,1
Comfortable and just the right weight,1
Nicely made with no loose threads,1
Fit is pretty much as expected,1
Seems to be holding up after being dry cleaned a few times,1
5 out of 5 stars,1
My only gripe is that I was expecting the stripes to be more subtle and less bold,2
"This is just my personal taste, but I wanted to wear this with a suit and tie, and the stripes seemed too bold for me to do that",2
"Otherwise it fit my 5???? 156lb frame perfectly and it?s suitable for casual Fridays, and with dress slacks and no tie",1
I wanted a new white all-cotton shirt,0
"Contrary to some other reviews, my shirt had a front pocket",0
"I am 5'8"" and 130"" and the 15"" x 32""/33"" shirt fit me fine",1
I would have liked for the sleeves to have been,2
"5"" longer but that is not a major issue",2
My only caution is that the shirt has not been washed yet so I cannot say anything about shrinkage,0
I love this shirt,1
"It is nicely breathable, fits like it should, and the collar keeps its form",1
Iron it with a little spray starch and it looks like it came from dry cleaners,1
"I have lots of higher end, more expensive shirts, but this one is in my weekly rotation during the summer",1
"33""-34"" is the normal length of long sleeves that I wear",0
"The first shirt I ordered with 32""-33"" sleeve length, but they were too short",2
"Fortunately, the shirt fit my son perfectly",1
"Since I really liked the shirt, I reordered 34""-35"" sleeve length and it fits me well",1
The shirt fits great and looks good out of the dryer,1
Unfortunately even after ironing it looks like it has static cling,2
I like that the Amazon essential regular fit shirts can be ordered by neck and sleeve size,1
The Amazon shirt fit at the waist is not baggy  and tucks in nice,1
Unfortunately I will not be purchasing again due to the unprofessional look of the shirt even after ironing,2
*Purchased for my husband to wear weekly with church pants,0
and suit,0
"This shirt works great as a basic, button down, dress shirt for men",1
The only thing that we don?t love about it is the fact that the sleeves can?t take cuff links,2
But it works nicely for church every week,1
"These shirts, made in Vietnam, are labeled ""Regular Fit",0
""" IME, they are not",2
"They seem to be more ""slim fit",2
""" I bought several on account of the price",0
Returned them all,2
"After all that, I will say they are made of good material and nicely sewn",1
I was hoping for a shirt that fit like a Brooks Brothers Regent fit 16,0
5 or 17 by 37,0
This is definitely tighter and too short to be a 37 sleeve length,2
I don't love the fabric,2
The sleeves are tight on my arms,2
"I'm 6'4"" 235, not huge arms",0
The neck was to tight ,2
but the rest of the shirt fit him perfectly,1
He looked so handsome,1
Neck was good,1
"Chest too small could not button, but I am a chesty female",2
"I shop mens because the fabric is thicker, warmer and overall it is higher quality than what is found in women's department",1
Length of sleeves was good,1
I will look for a larger size,0
"A great-looking, great-performing white shirt",1
Wrinkle free and not too see-through or anything like that,1
Fit as expected,1
This shirt is really a great value for the money,1
Thanks,1
This product was much too small for a regular fit 17 34/35,2
It was almost 2 inches from closing around my chest and stomach,2
"I'm 6'3"" 250 lbs and this size in other manufacturers fits just fine",0
Amazon should stay out of the manufacturing business and just ship products,2
"If you want a good shirt for about $20, these are great",1
I now have 3 different colors and very happy with them,1
"I am sure there are others with smoother fabric, but not for this price",1
Highly recommend them,1
"Nice, regular white shirt",1
Disappointed just a little that I had to get such a large neck size to get the right body fit,2
"I am assuming that the shirt fits well, because my brother is kinda picky",1
He asked for them because he liked wearing the same manufacturer and style in the past,1
Shirt was not as described,2
Amazon description was white shirt with blue stripes,2
Delivered shirt was white shirt with LARGE BROWN and blue stripes,2
Online picture also only showed narrow blue stripes,2
Very disappointing,2
I ordered a black one because my son needed to wear black shirt for his orchestra concerts,0
Unfortunately the shirt looks more dark navy than black amongst other players wearing black,2
Too late to return,0
"If you need real black shirt, do not order this",2
I love the fit on this shirt and the quality is great for the $,1
"I am 6' 2"" and 180 lbs",0
so I bought 3 of the slim fit as I normally fit in them better but the Amazon regular fit is actually pretty slim and a better fit for me,1
My husband is very muscular but short so finding him shirts is a struggle,0
5?? 17 1/2 neck,0
these shirts are affordable AND fit great,1
Nice material,1
We?re buying them in all the colors,0
Amazing for the price,1
Even without the great price a solid build of a shirt,1
I just got the shirt so my review is based on one try- on and no day to day wearing,0
The shirt looks to be well made,1
The material appears to be of good quality and is classy looking,1
I gave it four star because I have not had a chance to wear it for an extended time,0
Tight fit in the arms and chest,2
This is such a comfortable and professional work shirt,1
"The only complaint was that it was a little tighter on the shoulder/upper chest, but not bad",2
"If you are bulkier in this area and prefer the shirt slightly loose, then get a size bigger to avoid the ""slim fit",0
""" Would definitely order more of these",1
This brand is my sons go to,1
"It is well-made, is offered with longer arm which is always a problem for the man in my family",1
"Excellent cut, excellent fabric and as a seamstress, this is very important to me",1
fits well although I tried the slim fit which I usually have and that was tight,0
This fits just right,1
good quality and great value for money,1
Received the item crumpled in a plastic bag not the original packaging,2
I'm a professional,0
I like to use new shirts right out of the package,2
Impossible with this,2
It needs to go to the dry cleaners to be pressed,2
Now I have to wait for a refund before I can replace the shirt,2
This has never happened before,2
I'm quite disappointing,2
I washed and dried the shirt after trying them on to make certain they fit,0
"Initially, they fit great, but the shirts shrunk about 2 sizes after washing and drying and no longer fit at all",2
My Van Heusen shirt did not shrink,0
I would not recommend the Amazon Essentials shirts at all,2
I plan to return them and buy more Van Heusen shirts,2
I've worn a 16 1/2 x 34 dress shirt for over 20 years but this shirt did not fit me,2
"Also, the fabric is very thin for a dress shirt",2
"Accordingly, I returned it to Amazon and received a refund",0
a little tight at the waist,2
I really love the Amazon Essentials line,1
"For everyday casual clothing, you can't beat them",1
I own 3 shirts like these and they look great after 3 months of washing and wearing,1
I recommend looking at the polo,0
golf,0
shirts too,0
"This is a beautiful shirt, really looks good with all colors of sweaters",1
Nice fall and winter look,1
Thank you,1
I?m never buying another type of dress shirt,2
This is thin and cool so I?m looking forward to the summer with this shirt,2
This shirt fits like the general sizes as a regular fit,0
This is the dress shirt for the professionals,0
I?m 5????and about 200 lbs,0
I got a 17??and 34/35 sleeve length and it fits great,1
This seemed like more of a slim fit shirt,0
The cheat was tighter and so were the sleeves,2
Plus the pocket was placed a little to high on the shirt,2
I returned them,2
Surprisingly nice and good fitting shirt,1
Hard to believe that it's 100% cotton,1
Much Much nicer than any 100% cotton wash and wear shirt that I've ever owned,1
This I have been wearing to work,0
looks good,1
Fit as expected and I have had no issues,1
Held up over a couple of washes too,1
I like the price for the item and it fit me true to size,1
"This shirt was very tight around the chest and midsection, unlike every other shirt this size that I own/wear",2
Cannot comfortably wear it,2
Disappointing because it looked to be a nicely made shirt for a very reasonable price,2
It wasn't washed or dried - no shrinkage,0
Just runs small/tight,2
Huge value,1
"These shirts are constructed well, fit as expected, and don't cost a ton",1
Makes you wonder how companies can sell their shirts at $100+ when these are available,1
The sleeves and collar fit very nicely,1
However the body is more like a slim fit cut and that?s a problem when you?re a bigger guy like myself,2
When with a sweater it looks great and can leave a button undone if needed,1
Real decent shirt for the money,1
Good fit for a big guy,1
"Big as in fat, not athletic",2
"I have been wearing this on Zoom calls for 7 months now, hasn't needed ironing or washing yet",1
I normally wear a 17 1/2 and I am a 2 xl so like a 50 chest,0
I ordered a 18 /36 and the neck is way big and the body is made for a basketball player not a former Defensive lineman,2
I can button it but it is ridiculous,2
The good thing is its 20,1
00 and a nice fabric and weight,1
"Everything about the shirt is very good, the quality of fabric is fine, I would think you needed more thread count but then the price may go up",1
Product made in China,0
For some reason fit somewhat small,2
I have other shirts made in Bangladesh and they are a much better fit for the same size,2
"Fabric is not the softest, but I'd pick this shirt over the competitors who offer shirts at 3x the price",1
I would give it 4 stars if amazon created an amazon essentials dress shirt with a button down collar,0
"Note as mentioned in a couple of reviews, the shirt is a little tight in the way it is made",2
I ordered a 16,0
my normal size,0
and it just fits,1
My recommendation is order one half neck size up from your normal size,0
a 17 instead of 16,0
"Other than that, it is a very nice shirt",1
Very comfortable yet durable dress shirt,1
Have ordered many times,1
Good value,1
Surprisingly good quality shirt for the money,1
It ironed nicely out of the dryer and looks like any other more expensive shirt,1
Shirt came wrapped like I bought it at a suit store,1
Material felt like high quality,1
No odor,1
Ready to go out of the bag and not flimsy at all,1
Nice button down dress shirts,1
Two buttons on sleeves for comfort,0
Highly recommend this seller &amp,1
product,0
Fantastic Classic cut and construction-moderately priced,1
I love it,1
Great for everyday to the office use,1
"The material is good, the cut is very nice, the size is true",1
wonderful style and texture,1
"It just didn't fit me at 6'2"" and 230lbs",2
"Product for arm length and neck size fits accordingly, but the shirt doesn't match typical dimensions further down the chest and is extremely tight",2
"The shirt is marked as cotton, but it sure looks like polyester",2
"Whatever the fabric is, it is very thin, and transparent",2
If you don't wear an undershirt your body will show right through the fabric,2
"With an undershirt, the undershirt will show",2
"This short was bought before by someone that decide not to keep it, it came completely unfolded inside a plastic bag with nothing written",2
"this is an Amazon Essential product, can?t believe your quality control dis not catch it",2
worst packaging experience in more than 10 years with Amazon,2
It was a steal for what I paid for it,1
Very good quality and looks great,1
"Good quality overall, fits well, comfortable",1
Might just be a little below a name brand shirt but I am happy,1
The shirt came with a dirty package and a black smudge on the white shirt,2
"Further, the material was cheap and rough",2
"This 15 1/2 32-33 is not a regular fit although the label says ""Regular""",2
More importantly I normally find 32-33 length a bit long,0
"These sleeves are way to short, like 30-31",2
The neck is not too accurate either,2
Chinese garments come in  batches and this batch is mismarked,2
And I mean compared to other men's large sizes,0
"Seems well made, used for a play, and wearable, just not as comfortable",2
"Sleeves are longer than I expected but otherwise the shirt looks great, doesn?t wrinkle much and is a great value",1
Disappointed with the size,2
Every other company is true to fit,0
This one doesn?t close,2
Very upsetting,2
Love these shirts,1
Highest quality and fit of any other brand of white shirts I have purchased,1
"Preparing to order more but, alas, they have been discontinued",1
I took a chance on it and love it,1
The quality of the material is comparable to that of the Kenneth Cole shirts that I previously purchased,1
I really liked this shirt which was decently priced,1
$20 ,0
", although I have enjoyed other economy-priced shirts of comparable quality for less",0
My only suggestion is that it could be $2 less per shirt to be really competitive,0
This is a high quality shirt at less than half the price you would find in the stores,1
I highly recommend it,1
must write a rave review because guys gain weight in their gut not butt-thank you for a shirt that looks good on a big guy,1
Comfortable dress shirt for work,1
Irons easily,1
"Similar quality to local retailers, but much less expensive",1
I don't often wear dress shirts so this was perfect for me,1
After drying it needed to be ironed but since I won't be wearing it very much it was OK,1
Less expensive that other shirts,1
product fits great for my physique and texure very good for good price,1
keep up the good job amazon and their vendors as i feel,1
I love these shirts,1
For the price this shirt can not be beat,1
"Nice fit, and the collar looks great",1
Just make sure you buy some nice collar stays,0
Great shirt,1
"Very nicely made, but too tight in the waist",2
Classic fit doesn't mean full,0
It's still tailored,0
I couldn't find it in town,0
"So, got it online and I'm happy with it",1
Nice shirt for my new suit,1
Came right on time shirt is as expected,1
The shits wash well don't need much iron but a bit small the sleeves and the chest,2
I liked this shirt,1
"It fitted as expected, and it was an excellent purchase for the price",1
The shirt is acceptable in fit and material,1
Looks good and for the price is a good vlue,1
"While it was listed as ""regular"" fit, it was closer to ""trim"" fit, it seemed",2
Quality of cloth and stitching is good,1
The material is thinner than I was expecting,2
Certainly not see through but not thick like oxford cloth,0
He seems to them,0
They do seem easier to get get wrinkles out of,2
"Great shirt, great price",1
I ordered 2 more when they became available,1
"I bought the size 17"" 34L and needed 17 "" 36 make sure to check size before buying",0
"Product is not the quality of some higher end brands, but its not priced like them either",0
These are more than sufficient for my needs,1
"A good looking, well made, comfortable fitting shirt at a surprisingly low price",1
I will definitely be buying Amazon Essentials shirts again,1
Great materials,1
Just a good 100 percent cotton shirt love it,1
And wrinkle free,1
Best shirt I bought so far,1
Terrible,2
Yellowed cotton like they had been sitting around for years,2
I am amazed with the good quality of this shirt,1
I?ll keep buying for work,1
The material looks and feels good,1
Sizes run small,2
The size I ordered should be a little bigger then what you sent,2
It seems to be titer the other shirts I already own,2
Very comfortable,1
Looks nice,1
Easy with a tie due to spread collar,1
Gets compliments every time I wear it,1
Low maintenance,1
Fabric seems to be quite lightweight,1
Have not washed it yet to see how it looks after washing,0
Really like this shirt,1
Fits good,1
Good price,1
Excellent value for the money,1
The shirt came with a fit exactly as expected,1
Looks like a shirt worth twice what I spent,1
Good basic white shirt for my teen to wear with a suit 3-4 times a yr,1
For the price this is a nice shirt,1
It fit perfectly,1
Buttons are sewn on well and the shirt is comfortable,1
Out of the bag there are not super sharp creases,0
I was in a hurry and wore it out of the bag,0
Decent for the money,1
I have a gentleman should have pressed white dress shirts to wear,0
"At this price I bought 5, one for each day of the week",0
"Good quality, good fit and the cloth is soft",1
Wow,1
This wrinkle resistant shirt looks perfect right out of the dryer,1
Like it actually had been ironed,1
Will purchase again,1
I had to return the shirt because the shirt is made of a super thin material in which an undershirt can be visible,2
This shirt is not cut out to be used for business purposes,2
My husband loves these and wants no other shirts now,1
Many people complained of the slim fit - for him it was perfect and had no bubble in the back like many lower cost shorts have,1
dress shirt for Church and I should get a free shirt or a refund with a 1/2 larger in the neck size and see how that works,2
I guess its time to go to Macy`s,2
which I hate going to the malls,2
I`ve bought 83 items in the past year from Amazon,0
Hmmmmm,0
"Nice dress shirt, no wrinkles and looks sharp",1
The price was also nice,1
Launders well,1
returned it as not as described,2
"It should have been described as a red and blue tattersall, not a red tattersall",2
Too long blew thigh almost to the knee,2
Shirt sleeve length is 32/33 so why the shirt is too long in length,2
"VERY well made, actually better than some of the more expensive brands, and irons",1
yes irons,1
like a dream,1
Fits fine and good value with 2 pack,1
Good shirt for the price,1
"As far as wrinkle resistant, not as good as brooks brothers, but not a $135 shirt either",1
Not sure on overall durability yet but would buy again,1
It's NOT wrinkle resistant,2
It's 100% cotton,0
Not sure why it says it is,2
A great shirt at this price,1
Very pleased with this product,1
I really like the quality and the feel of this shirt,1
It feels like a premium shirt- not a $20 bargain,1
I like loose shirts so the size is good for me,1
Plus I am a small guy,0
So the fit will prob be perfect for a regular sized guy,1
Just ordered another 3 shirts,1
"Not to bad, a little big and stiff",2
Color is great no fading,1
Not bad for a budget but,1
This fabric feels like a quality shirt,1
I will be buying more,1
This is a super nice shirt and especially at this price point,1
Quality seems to match that of name brand shirts I?ve bought in the past,1
I bought this shirt in my normal shirt size and it fit as if it were two sizes too small,2
Waist too small for reg fit 17,2
5 neck,2

I will order 2 more shirts soon,1
Fits as expected,1

"I'm 6' 2"" amd fit",0
I wear a 16,0
"5"" neck and 34/35 length",0
I ordered the same here and fit perfect,1
The quality has led me to look at other Amazon Essential clothing options,1
"CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP, FOCUS ON THE SELLING AND STOP TRYING TO BECOME A DESIGNER",1
I just wish Amazon did a better job of keeping other styles of this shirt in stock,0
Nice shirt and a good bargain,1
My son wore this to work and while the fit was good,1
The entire sleeve just ripped,2
It was not abused in any way,0
Don't waste your money,2
A little scratchy but good for the price,0
Arrived just in time for me to wear to a wedding,1
Fit perfectly and looked good,1
The shirt is very uncomfortable I am going to try to return it,2

I returned this item due to fabric quality,2
It is way too thin,2
Great print,1
"Surprised by fit, have never bought an Amazon brand shirt, very happy",1
The product fit well for the first few weeks but then after the first wash it just fit weird,2
I like the spread collar and fit,1
Looks great in a suit and tie,1
Good value for money quickly shipped,1
The shirt fit itself is good however after washing it is extremely wrinkly and attracts lint as if it was itself a lint roller,2
I bought this for my Mitsuba cosplay and it works perfectly,1
It's the right length and size plus it color matched his canon clothes perfectly,1
"If you're gonna cosplay Mitsuba, this shirt is perfect",1

Good quality and was designed well,1
Washes up well,1

3rd amazon shirt I have bought they have been very good quality and fit perfect,1
"Unlike some of the other shirts I?ve bought, I like the length of this one",1
I don?t have to keep tucking it into my pants,1
Fits smaller than sized,2
It was just what I wanted a well made shirt I just got a size to small I haven't tried on shirts in a long time I've gained weight but it looks good with my dark blue leather blazer,1
This is an exceptional shirt,1
Better than expected,1
KUDOS,1
"Great fabric, Great fit, great length",1

"Great quality, low price",1
Looks super,1
These run small,2
"Normal, good quality shirt",1
Good,1

Great fit looking to buy more when in stock,1
a little tight,2
Well tailored looked great felt great,1
good quality,1
The item had clearly been open before and repackaged in a messy manner,2
Have had others before and none like this,1
"Las 3 camisas salieron como esperaba, pero fueron entregadas por el vendedor, como si fueran 3 camisas compradas por separado, a pesar de ser cobradas con la misma factura",0
Good,1
They are almost a yellowish color not a nice simple white color,2
This is a good fitting and good looking shirt,1

Very nice shirt with a nice pocket as promised and very good fit,1

Good purchase at a great price,1
I'll be back to buy more,1
i ordered a size 18 and it feels like it runs a bit tight compared to other brands,2
The quality of this shirt is wonderful for the price with its sturdy collar and cuffs,1
It has kept its color after numerous washes now with no signs of fading,1
I recommend Amazon Essential brand shirts to anyone who asks where to find a good shirt,1
Returned as shirt ws skimpy around the waist,2
"Very nice shirt, fits well, and good quality",1
"I have quite a few different brands of dress shirts, and I was incredibly impressed with the quality of this shirt",1
I will definitely be purchasing more,1
I would like to see more cuff options in the future,0

"Love It,not bad it all",1
Fine shirt for the price,1
"Great fit, the neck is perfect",1

GREAT PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE,1
Fits me like a tailored shirt,1
"I'm 6'2"" 220 and for $20 there is no better shirt out there",1

Had to send back,2
A little tight otherwise surprisingly nice shirt,1
What a great shirt at a great price,1
Since this is sized with US measurements I was confident I would get the size I needed as surely as if I went to the store and bought it,1
Very satisfied,1
The cloth is low quality and thin,2
Transparent,2
Buttons dont sit well,2
Soooooooo scratchy,2

Great shirt,1
Excellent shirt,1
The color was pale pink and perfect for a beach Valentine's Day wedding,1
The shirt was tight for the neck and sleeve length ordered,2
Maybe because it is made in China and the shapes are different,2
Great value for the price,1
Nice shirt,1
"Very nice, as expected and good for a basic white work shirt",1
"If you?re at all athletic/slim, know that you?d need to take it in at the waist in order to avoid a bulky look",0
A litle tight at waist,2

Couldn't wear it so cannot comment on quality,2
Great fit,1

Ready to wear right out of the package,1
Perfect,1

I couldn't even button it,2
It fit as expected,1
Would purchase again,1

Too tight,2
Shirt looked good and felt good,1
A little bit tight around chest and restricting when lifting arms,2

"Great fit, great price, fashionable",1
This was a shirt for my work,1
It was great and I may buy more,1
The label on the shirt indicated 16,0
"5 X 34, which is what I ordered",0
But it was not even close,2
It was probably 15 X 34,2
The fabric is a bit rough but other than that it is a very good shirt,2
Too small,2

All white event,0
Fit poor,2
This review is for the white version,0
"It's a very nicely made shirt, and all of the seams are impeccable with a very small number of uncut threads in places",1
"I find it to be true to size, with one caveat regarding the sleeves",1
"The sleeve length is perfect with my arms down, but the sleeves ride up more than those on my other dress shirts when I raise my arms",0
"These have removable collar stays, which is my preference",1
The one thing that I like the least,1
"and the reason for four stars instead of five, even at this price",0
is that the fabric is more transparent than my other shirts,2
"At least with the white color, you'll see skin or an undershirt through it",2
"It's not horrible, mind you, but I prefer a more opaque fabric",2
"All in all, a nice shirt and a good value at the",1
current,1
$20 price point,1
"This is a beautiful, pure white shirt",1
"When I get a new white shirt, I do not usually take it out of its wrap that it comes in, because white shirts begin to age immediately, they begin to turn yellowish or dull",0
"That is why men who must wear suits and ties to work must have a constant new supply of white shirts with long sleeves, in order to look their best,  The men get to the point when they can spot an older white shirt on a colleague, and then they start to think less of this colleague",0
"You can solve this by occasionally wearing a blue shirt or a yellow shirt, if it matches your suit and socks, but best practice is to wear a gleamingly new white shirt",0
"It must have long sleeves, as it is unprofessional to show your arms bare, even on the hottest days",0
This goes for women too - a businesswoman should not show bare arms,1
Or too much neck,0
It is unprofessional,0
"As for hemlines, below the knee is best",1
"I am an expert on dressing for the corporation, after having worked in the corporate world most of my life",0
"Anyway, back to this shirt",0
"As I said, I opened it and tried it on, and the sleeves are a bit too long",2
Too long is better than too short,0
"Too long can be solved with a pair of good, old-fashioned sleeve garters that are white so that they don't stand out",0
Sleeve garters can be found at haberdashery shops or sometimes in the men's department of a good department store,0
"So, you should have sleeve garters on hand",0
The size of a shirt is determined by the neck size,0
"Unfortunately, I have always had a sensitive neck, so I must get a shirt with a neck size of 17 at least",0
This way I won't be pulling at my neck all day long,0
The top button must always be fastened or you will look slovenly,0
"Also, your tie must be tied properly - a double Windsor knot is best",0
Please do not use a clip-on tie or a bow tie,0
"Once in a while, a bow tie is acceptable - maybe once or twice a year, and it must be 100% silk - in fact, all ties must be 100% silk and you are judged by your tie's design and color",0
I have at least 150 ties,0
I do not wear striped ties,0
"I prefer ties with abstract designs, paisleys, and other different designs, and ties must look fresh and unwrinkled",0
The color of a tie is important,0
"I tend toward blues, purples, and lavenders, with intricate patterns",0
"Once in a while I'll wear one of my favorites - a water-colored street scene in Paris, or a dark blue tie with light blue colored turtles that I bought in Switzerland - but do not wear favorites over and over",0
I have a black tie with red polka dots on it that I wear when I don't feel good,0
"When you have many ties, you can just grab one in a hurry and wear it and it'll be fine",0
"Again, back to the shirt",0
"If you can see your skin through the shirt, you must wear a well-fitting white undershirt with short sleeves",0
"You don't want to show your nipples or an extremely hirsuit body, or any scars",0
I have had heart surgery so I always wear an undershirt,0
"To wrap this up, this is a good and useful shirt, but you must adhere to what I have said if you wish to appear well dressed",1

We got the purple tattersall and I have to say it's much better looking in person,0
The squares are a lot cleaner looking and not as small as they seem online,1
"The up-close listing pic shows it better, I think",0
"It is somewhat non-wrinkly, if I hang it right out of the dryer",1
"That's useful, since we're casual sorts",1
He says it's comfortable to wear as far as fit,0
"No binding, it moves nicely",1
"I do feel like it will wash softer over time, which will make it perfect",1
"But 4 stars for now, sorry",0
"Thanks for not using pins, though",1

Amazon brands are increasing their scope of affordable products especially in their clothing lines and this shirt is a great example,1
The colors and pattern is conservative  enough to be warn in a business setting but is equally at home at a relaxed casual outing,1
Equally at home under a suit or paired with blue jeans or khakis,1
Construction and cut share details of shirts costing twice the price,1
The collar stays for example are removable and can be replaced with new plastic ones or metal inserts if you have them,0
The sleeves have dual buttons to accommodate your wrist size or watch  and the  sleeve placket also has a button,0
Extra buttons are sewn inside the bottom of the front packet to replace any that might come off over time,0
Stitching is clean and straight,1
"There's a single front breast pocket and the alignment of the fabric pattern matches perfectly the underlying shirt pattern, which is critical in plaid shirt especially",1
Price is very affordable especially if you compare it to any designer label,1
"Money was saved on the shirt fabric as it is a lightweight cotton and suitable, but it isn't a more substantial weave and cotton you would expect to find on a fine shirt",0
So while entirely suitable and attractive it will not replace a high end shirt if that's what you're expecting,0
"I received the 32/33 inch sleeve and 16"" neck which I should not have ordered knowing my arms are extra long, and as expected, if I stretch my arms out straight, the sleeves are just not long enough",2
The cut leans more toward an athletic cut so works best with a slimmer torso,0
"All told, a very good value for the price",1
Attractive and versatile,1
A small deduction for the lower end weight and lack of heft of the fabric,0
"My husband seems to wear a popular size when it comes to dress shirts, so finding them in the local stores can be tough-so I often order online",0
For the most part-men's fitted shirts like this,0
sized collar and sleeve length,0
"seem to fit pretty universally, but for some reason I found this a bit big when he tried it on",2
Granted many companies now make a 'regular' fit and slim fit,0
"This is a regular cut, but still seems a bit big in the chest area",2
"However, a good white shirt is always needed-and because this one seems to run a bit big, my husband can wear it with our without a tie-with for work, without for a more casual, business look",0
"The shirt is well made-buttons sewn on properly, cuffs stitched nicely and the collar lies flat",1
"The material is soft without being too sheer, but has enough rigidity to not look sloppy",1
And the price point makes this a steal,1
"less than $25 for a well made, men's dress shirt?  Yes please",1
"Overall, I like this shirt -- it fits pretty well, it's attractive, and it's well-made",1
Fabric is strong without being rough or stiff,1
Seams are clean and strong,1
The plaid pattern is muted and attractive,1
Fits in with what all the other guys at my office job are wearing,1
My one complaint is that the arms/shoulders are a bit snug,2
"I've cultivated a bit of a belly over the years, and this fits well through the midsection, but it's just a touch tight through the shoulders, and it's snug enough on the arms that flexing my bicep makes me feel like the Hulkamaniac",2
"On the other hand, it's a dress shirt",0
"It doesn't give enough freedom of movement for the secret service, but if you're like me and you spend 8 hours sitting in front of a computer, it's not going to be a problem",0
"This is a quality dress shirt and a bargain at the price -- take that, designers",1
"I have deducted one star because arm movement is slightly restricted -- if you raise your arms, the shirt body lifts up as well",2
A little more give under the arms would be welcome,2
"Otherwise, though, the shirt has everything I like -- a chest pocket, spread collar with slots for stays, two spare buttons attached to the hem, a good long hem, etc",1
The finish seems topnotch -- no loose threads -- and the fabric is 100% cotton for breathability,1
The colors are subdued in this purple tattersall version -- they appear to be a muted purple and gray,0
"All in all, then, this is a great shirt for the money, and the movement issue probably won't matter to workers sitting at desks",1
It is hard to believe that this shirt can be offered at its price point,1
What an incredible value for $20,1
I usually wear a medium or 15 and 1/2 inch neck and the fit was right on,0
This is a very good quality dress shirt with modern styling,1
"The material is thin, which I like as it permits an undershirt and takes an iron well",1
Thicker shirt material tends to be more difficult to iron,0
"Cant speak about longevity, so you may want to bump up in quality if you plan to wear frequently",0
The design is a bit dull and it would be great if they had some more colorful and progressive patterns,2
"However, for an occasional dress shirt user who is on a budget, I just don't see how you could go wrong",1
And I mean that,0
"The shirt is 100%, all in, designed for the office",1
It's the archetypal dress shirt,0
"While yeah, I guess it *could* be used for casual wear",0
it's not going to look casual,0
It's going to look like you're trying too hard,0
"Everything about the tailoring and materials just says ""wear me with a suit and tie",0
"The shirt itself fits just right to size - sleeve length is appropriate, shirttail length is appropriate, and the material is thin enough to be comfortable under a jacket",1
"In sum, a perfectly suitable, not-fancy-just-classic dress shirt",1
A very good piece,1
"I've had good luck with a lot of Amazon Essential stuff, so I'm really surprised about this shirt",2
"First, it doesn't fit well",2
The belly is too tight and the shoulders are,2
"they manage to be both tight and loose at the same time, don't ask me how",2
"The material is also somewhat stiff and uncomfortable, not at all like some of the others",2
"And lastly, the pattern is much bolder than the picture lead me to believe",2
This is a great basic dress shirt that goes with anything,1
It fits well and came out of the wash without shrinking,1
"It's 100% cotton, so it takes a light steaming or ironing, but doesn't need a lot",1
"I wear dress shirts several times a week, and this is one of my new favorites",1
The double pleats really help with range of shoulder motion,1
I'm adding this shirt in outher colors to my wardrobe ASAP,1
"This is a thinner fabric, but not flimsy or super-sheer",1
"The construction is of good quality, and it looks very polished and classy",1
Great value,1
"You can always pay more for higher quality textiles, but for basic button-down-white-shirt, this is a very economical one that presents well",1
I'm so happy to have this shirt,1
"I have been going to a million weddings, and a decent-quality dress shirt is exactly what I need",1
"The white is a good color, the material is comfortable, and overall, it's an attractive shirt",1
"Honestly, no one would ever know that it's ""Amazon Essentials"" brand",1
I highly recommend this shirt for anyone who tears through dress shirts and simply needs more in their arsenal,1
This is a well made white dress shirt,1
It is a must have for all men's wardrobes,1
"It comes in 6 colors: black, blue, lavender, light blue, pink and white",0
The shirt is long sleeve and is a button up design,0
"The hem is rounded, with a double pleat in back, rounded single button cuffs, a chest pocket and spread collar",0
This shirt can be dressed up or down depending on what you wear with it,0
A very nice look,1
"I am pleased with the fit, quality, and feel of this shirt",1
PROS:,1
Excellent fit,1
100% cotton and keeps the body cool,1
Great looks,1
Machine washable,1
CONS:,2
Small imperfections like extra string hanging off some buttons,2
The fit of this shirt rivals that of Banana Republic or J,1
Penny,1
"Give it a shot, you may like it",1
"I've worn a size 18 shirt for many years, and sometimes they're a little small, it all varies by manufacturer",0
But this was ridiculously too small,2
"Wherever these are made, someone needs to give them an accurate sizing guide",2
This shirt is very stylish and fits perfectly for my size,1
The sizing is comparable and matches exactly with what I would expect compared to other shirts I have in this size,1
"I have gotten quite a few compliments from people at work when I wear this shirt, so that is a tremendous positive",1
I would definitely be interested in purchasing other shirt designs of this product,1
The shirt that was mailed to me is not the shirt in the main picture,2
Please be advised that this shirt has one basic pocket on the left and not two as shown in the picture,2
I am disappointed and think that this discrepancy should be addressed by Amazon,2
Beautiful shirt,1
Excellent quality,1
Fit my boyfriend perfectly,1
I ordered a large,0
The actual shirt is so much nicer than the online pictures,1
Colors are a little more vivid than what the pictures show,2
My boyfriend loved this shirt,1
This is a fairly good dress shirt,1
It is thin so it looks best if you wear an undershirt under it,0
It is basically an wrinkle free shirt,0
It has good stitching and is a good fit,1
The regular fit seems to run only slightly larger than some of our other dress shirts,0
"However, overall it?s a good shirt",1
We machine wash and line dry,0
This is a gorgeous shirt,1
"It is very well made, fits well and washes beautifully",1
"The fabric has very fine lines of purple and blue for a very subtle, mostly white, plaid",1
The shirt comes out of the dryer ready to wear,1
"It is not slim fit, but regular fit",0
"Next time my hubby needs a dress shirt, we will definitely order another",1
"This shirt is a nice, basic white dress shirt",1
The fabric is a little thin,2
"I don't normally like wearing an undershirt but with this one, I would recommend it",2
The rest is fine,1
"The fit, for me, is fine",1
"It is a little slim, but I also gained a little weight",0
It washes well and irons nicely,1
Fits as expected and the design is classic dress shirt,1
Crisp white color and the stitching is high quality,1
I also like the material very much too,1
It feels good yet holds its shape well even with no or very minimal starch and it is not too thin i,1
not see through at all,1
Pinpoint weave,1
Thi s white cotton dress shirt is ideal for the office,1
It isnicely constructed and true to size,1
I like the double pleat int eh bck and the rounded hem,1
The fabric is light and a bit transparent,2
Undershirts are visible underneath,0
It launders nicely and is a nice quality business essential,1
"This is more of a basic dress shirt, was hoping for a more modern/smooth fit",2
"The collar feels like it's on the larger side for the size, and the arms where the connect feel like they are a bit restricting, not a great fit, ends up being a bit boxy",2
The fabric pattern is subtle but nice,1
Fits well and looks great,1
"It's a bit stiff, and even after some dry-cleaning there isn't much give",2
The material and the cut are similar to more expensive brands from major department stores,1
No way anyone would guess this is an Amazon Essentials brand shirt,1
"I will be ordering more as they are great for office, church or going out",1
The neck fits me perfectly,1
The sleeves are too long,2
The length of the shirt tails is ideal,1
The diameter of the chest is too large,2
"A shame, as the check pattern is perfect, the construction is sound, and the buttons are neatly and tightly sewn on",1
"Nice quality construction, with good attention to finish details",1
"The fabric is attractive, and the spread collar works well with or without a tie",1
"It is amply cut across the belly, so if you prefer a trim or athletic fit, this is not for you",0
Very nice and crisp dress shirt,1
The tattersall plaid pattern is subtle,1
"However, I think the shirt fits a size too small, or maybe I am a size too big?",2
"Anyway , it has a really nice feel, 100% cotton",1
"An 18"" neck and a 36""37"" arm shouldn't have a chest/waist size for a 120 lb man",2
"These shirts were off the chart small, except in the neck and arm length",2
This could have been a Arrow shirt in the 1960s,0
Old school / classic mens' dress shirt,0
"Medium weight fabric, traditional cut and decent fabric",1
Should be good for many wearings,1
This is a well-made shirt,1
"subtle, tattersall pattern with purple lines, appropriately labeled ""essential""",1
Certainly versatile and comfortable,1
Can be worn with slacks or jeans,1
Good price too,1
This runs a bit big as often happens with Amazon shirts,2
It's a nice dress shirt in a comfortable fabric,1
The collar does not button down,2
"The fabric is bit thin, slightly see-through",2
A classic fit that?s not billow-y,2
What a concept,0
This fits great,1
Amazon clothing is on par with most mall/department store/big box retail in terms of quality,1
Great value,1
A white button down shirt is a staple in the wardrobe of many men,1
This fits the bill,1
It fits as expected and looks as pictured,1
Solid shirt,1
I have not had good luck finding a really nice dress shirt online,0
"Usually the fabric is too thin, the cut is too narrow, etc",0
This fits the bill perfectly,1
This shirt is a great fit for my husband,1
true to size,1
"He says it is comfortable and easy care, wrinkle-free",1
We've washed it a few times and it looks great,1
"Good price conscience shirt for my slender, tall sons",1
"It's a little thin in the fabric, but is fine with an undershirt",0
"Comfortable fabric, well-made",1
The pattern is nice and the colors subdued,1
Will wash easily and seems durable overall,1
Very nice quality for the price,1
Great work shirt,1
"The  34/35 is about one inch longer, really a 35/36 and more on the 36"" length",2
"Otherwise a great looking shirt, especially for the price",1
Fit perfectly and made with quality material,1
These shirts are the best dress shirts for work,1
I bought 10 of them,1
They don?t cost that much so you can buy plenty and not worry about throwing one away if you stained it,1
Very nice quality dress shirt,1
Goes with Levi?s and or slacks and fits very nice with a vest and tie,1
Perfect fit after measuring,1
The shirt did not leave much room and I had to order a size larger than normal and it still did,0
This is a great shirt for the price,1
Needed them for funeral,0
color was what we needed,1
Like,1
For me,1
Stuff is really nice but the color is too light,0
I love being able to get a shirt with a choice of sleeve length as I have short arms,0
I'm a 17,0
"5 "" neck and only 5'9"" tall so usually end up with shirts tailored for a gorilla",0
These shirts fit,1
Are well made summer weight shirts,0
I usually pay twice the price at M&amp,0
"S, and the sleeves never fit",0
I have all 4 choices for this reason and wish they did more,0
Very good quality shirt,1
little on the large side but very comfortable,1
One problem however is that the sleeves are really long and I have fairly long arms,2
Great when rolled up but I will need arm braces to wear under a suit,2
Paul,0
Really good fit,1
Fits round my stomach nicely which not all shirts do,1
Arms fit well and are of a generous fit,1
Nice finish hopefully will wear well,1
I am long in the body so 37??sleeve gives you a much longer shirt to fit in the waist,0
Great fit and great material and very smart collar,1
"Very happy , i have the set ie 4 shirts",1
Recommend,1
I have lots of coloured shorts but this allowed a sensible price short in white wrinkle free well easier to iron,1
Fits well and feels comfy,1
Nice looking well made shirt,1
Washes well and dries fairly crease free,1
I hate ironing,0
Few minutes in tumble dryer on decrease setting and it?s ready to wear again,1
Very Good Quality and Very Good Presentation,1
I feel very well with it,1
I will buy some more,1
Love this shirt very nice quality and a good fit looked very smart sadly it was ordered for a funeral,1
The sleeves on this shirt were really short and the fit on the body was boxy,2
Not sure who this would actually fit,2
The shirt looks very good,1
It is to be sent as a present so can't say how it fits yet,0
Great value for money,1
Great fit,1
Washes well,1
Looks very nice on too,1
Good shirt but the delivery service was terrible,2
Bought for my dad,0
They're his favourite shirts,1
good material good value great thank you,1
Good fit round my larger body,1
Feels like good quality but not worn yet as using short sleeves,1
"OMG, what a brilliant quality/ fit shirt for knocking around in",1
You could easily wear it with a suit and tie if you don?t mind a single cuff,1
Well made,1
Smaller than a 4x should be,2
Tight round chest,2
My other 4x fits fine,0
Beautiful blue shirt ?,1
Greatly value for money and a perfect fit,1
Quality,1
Excellent fit,1
And goes with my suit,1
Smooth and comfy,1
Haven?t wished it yet so don?t know post wash condition,0
I'm not sure what others are complaining about regarding the sizing,0
"It fits my fat belly perfectly well, and I received exactly what i was expecting",1
Neck size 18,0
5 matches up very well with other shirts I have of that size,1
More than enough room in the body,1
This is not slim-fit at all,1
"Material seems a little flimsy, but not too bad",0
Certainly nothing to complain about for the price,1
We'll see how well and long it lasts,0
"Any better than 6 months and I'd say it's worth the money, though I'd rather spend more for something that will last longer",0
Only complaint is that there are little plastic bits in the collar to keep it pointed,2
"My collar only had one of these in place, as the little pocket for them is left open on one end",2
Must have fallen out somewhere along the way,2
These shirts are a really good deal,1
"They fit as expected, though they're a little long",0
"Shouldn't pose a problem, though",0
"Material is nice, will probably work well in the warmer weather",1
"It looks sharp, will do very nicely for the office",1
Wish there was some way to be notified when the other colours I want in my size come back in stock,0
This product appears and feels on the cheap side,1
"But for $26 it is not bad, I just expected more",2
"If Amazon Essentials were to come out with a premium line, that likely would be better",0
"Would I purchase again, no",2
I have not tried other AE clothing products and not sure I would further,2
My wrinkle free non iron shirt arrived rolled up in a ball in a very small bag,2
see photo,0
Terrible packaging by amazon had to pay $5 for dry cleaning to get all the wrinkles out,2
So much for wrinkle free,2
Very nice shirt,1
"Given its low price, I was expecting only a reasonably made product, but the quality of the shirt actually exceeds my expectation",1

this is the regular size that I take but the body on these shirts was a little bit narrower than all my others,2
"Also, it was not as wrinkle free as I had hoped and collar absorbs neck skin oil very quickly",2
