sentence,sentiment
i went out with this sweet ass shirt,
"before i knew it, i had a harum of adoring women and cats fighting for their lives to bed me",
just buy the shirt dude,
got this shirt for a wedding,
i am 180lb and 5'10'',
i got a large and it fit perfectly,
my neck is 16 1/2  - 17,
pros:,
- very good fit,
- very nice material,
- had the wedding outside in very hot fl and i didn't sweat in it,
- comfortable,
- good price,
cons:,
- a few loose annoying threads hanging at the sleeve and other seams,
i cut them with small scissors,
"gf bought me a different shirt to wear to a party,",
"but i didn't like it - got this in before the party, put it on for her, and she liked it more than her choice's fit and color",
"i like it, too",
i followed their recommended sizing and ordered a medium taking a chance on it being small since they said it runs small,
"it came in a 42, which is not a medium and although they attached a medium tag, the shirt was large",
"and in their pictures it looks like a narrow athletic waist and below,",
but actually flares out a little,
not like the picture at all,
"this is a really great shirt, i’m 511 and  weigh 190 and extra lage is perfect for me",
i just wish it was just little bit longer because every now and then i find myself keep  having to tuck in my shirt,
other than that no complaints,
loved the material and the color was as shown,
great looking shirt for the price range,
just be sure to get 1 size larger than you normally wear,
"yes, i was aware it was slim fit when i purchased it/",
awesome shirt,
i actually have the white and light blue versions of this shirt,
the quality of these shirts is better than some i've purchased at department stores,
arrived neatly folded and was easy to iron,
i wish they added a light yellow version of this shirt,
my family &amp,
i took maturnity photos,
the shirt fit my husband as expected,
great material and it’s not see through,
the feel of the material is great too,
really impressed with such a moderately priced shirt,
"i am 6'2"" and vary between 190-200lbs and i purchased a medium",
this fit me perfectly,
i am the type of person that pays to get shirts fitted and i have been leaning more towards these stretch shirts because they are so cheap and look so nice,
"if it breaks, i replace it with another one",
it's cheaper that buying a $100 shirt and paying $35 for a good tailor,
a little tight around the neck,
but nothing to worry about,
"overall, awesome shirt",
fantastic fit,
it fit me like a glove,
dad bod to athletic build,
basically muscles under flab lol,
super soft as well,
"my favorite part is i can never find a size that fits my larger neck, with a large adam's apple",
but not be baggy in the waist,
usually larger necks are larger sizes all around,
not in this case,
larger neck in average sizes,
i will definitely buy more from this brand,
"i like the look and material, good price as well",
"however, i’m a tall 6’1” and weight about 225 lbs, and the xl was still a little snug",
sleeves were a tad bit too short,
"considering getting another one just because i do like the appearance and price,",
"however, i’m hesitant given that this is the largest shirt they sell",
i ordered large which is my usual size for a dress shirt that i wear with a suit,
this large shirt was a little more snug,
"but i didn't mind because i'm wearing this shirt with casual clothing like chino pants, jeans, etc",
fits great,
only downside is,
i will still wear outside of work as it is very comfortable,
bought this back in sept 2018,
"unfortunately after a couple years of rolling the sleeves just behind the elbow, it eventually tore",
"couldn't find one i liked better, so ordering a new one now",
i thought it would not fit,
but i was surprised,
it fits well and moves with you and is super comfy,
"bought it for graduation and i am 5'1, 36 in the waist",
excellent dress shirt,
very happy with this purchase,
dress shirt looks great and is really very comfortable,
the size was just fine for me and seems accurate,
i would definitely  recommend to others,
this shirt was alot better than expected,
actaully a little too nice for what i wanted it for,
i'm definitely gonna look on point rocking this shirt,
used size chart and it fits my fiancé perfectly,
my man runs slim in the waist &amp,
it doesn’t look too baggy on him,
"material is very soft, and somewhat textured",
it's not quite tailored in the waist section,
"great quality, elegant, formal, casual, easy to iron, you don't need an undershirt",
i used this shirt for a modern tuxedo,
i highly recommend this shirt,
ordered my usual size and the shirt fit fine,
"the fabric has the synthetic shine which i don't like,",
but i like the pale blue color and richer ribbed texture,
i've only worn it a few times and it is ready for the trash,
some spots on the fabric look like someone took sandpaper to it with no explanation,
overall a waste of money,
other shirts in this price range are a better choice,
"my son is a medium in everything,  with some things being a little large and others being a little small",
i got him a large in this based on reviews,
it was amazingly too small,
"seems like a nice shirt,",
but the sizing is way off,
it really is a nice dress shirt,
pay attention to the measurements,
pleasantly surprised by this shirt,
"i'm 6'1, wear a 42 jacket, and the large fit well",
i got white and it's not see through,
fabric quality is good with cool ribbing texture,
very basic dress shirt,
"better for jeans or khakis and a casual jacket, not with dress slacks imo",
"i like slim/tailored/athletic cut dress shirts, and liked how this shirt looked on me right away",
i'll be getting more,
muy linda pero muy difícil de limpiar por que la puse a lavar y no se limpia bien las mangas quedaron manchadas,
i love quality of the material,
but it could be more slimmer on the arms,
"overall, it is awesome",
i love these shirts so much i bought 4 of them,
the fit is perfect tucked or un-tucked,
the fabric is pretty with a bit of a pattern on it,
"super good quality and very comfortable,",
however most definitely get a one size up:,
i still wore the medium,
but my athletic build made very tight on the chest and i could put my arms all the way in the air without serious discomfort,
i’m 5’10 and 180lbs,
"me gustó mucho, y me quedo excelente",
i wasn't aware it has a stripe pattern in it or weave that looks like a cheap poly white shirt,
thought this would be a standard white cotton dress shirt,
this is such an amazing-looking shirt,
and my son loves the material too,
it has a slight sheen to it and an almost invisible pinstripe,
"very dressy, very classy",
it fits perfectly,
my son is super skinny 5’4” and 102 pounds,
i bought a small and looks great,
only thing is there are really small lines in the shirt that i was not expecting,
but it does not affect the look,
"my experience with buying formal wear online has been mixed at best,",
but this was a huge exception,
the quality of the shirt and its material are first-rate and it arrived on my doorstep within 2 days of purchase,
good,
"fit perfectly, im 5'10 , 160 pounds and got a large",
"material is bit thin though,",
but not a big problem,
this shirt is worth the money,
purchased for my son and he  loves this shirt and so does his girlfriend,
i will definitely purchase other colors,
tela de perfecta calidad,
me fascinó,
gracias,
it was very short on my soon to be hubby,
"it is also an odd material, not your typical light dress shirt",
it is thick as well which is not a good thing for a summer wedding,
great shirt for word,
grear fabric,
i ordered  a pair of this in white color and light blue,
love the way it fits and feels comfortable,
definitely will buy again if it has more light colors,
this material feels like nirvana,
love everything about this shirt,
my husband is a mens small and it fit great in that size,
son needed a shirt quick for a school performance,
arrived as expected via prime and fit well,
"for a shirt that won’t be work more than 5 times, zero complaints",
i purchased this for work and specifically require a non-textured white shirt,
the photos indicated that there was no texture,
"however, this is completely unusable for my job",
fit was a bit larger than expected,
and the collar seems horrifically unaligned at best,
incredibly disappointed,
"please, take care about packaging",
expensive for the quality,
size okay,
"but the bag was riped and  i have to wash this shirt, because is dirty",
this dress shirt met my expectation,
"it is very comfortable, fits well, properly tailored and the color is soft and ""easy of the eyes""",
i purchased this shirt for work,
however i am considering purchasing another for church,
this is a slim fitted shirt,
"i was not expecting it to be a sort of ribbed material,",
but it does add a little bit to they style,
if you are a guy with large arms and forearms,
"this one may not be for you, unless you want to hulk out of the shirt",
i bought a large and it hugs around the arms,
nice dress shirt,
nice packaging fits well,
perfect fit,
he has a smaller waist and large shoulders and arms and it fit perfectly,
shirt fits good and seems to be of good quality,
really satisfied,
"would purchase again, very unique material to what i'm used to wearing",
but i like,
excellent,
nice shirt,
fits perfect and looks great,
one of my favorite shirts,
"cheaply made,",
but look at the price,
"great to wear for a couple special occasions, then it falls apart",
quality shirt,
love the design,
fits more like a skinny and not slim,
order one to two sizes larger,
purple was a little darker than i thought,
but nothing i can’t live with since everything else is perfect,
great,
excellent shirts,
true to size and material stays wrinkle free after long days,
great fitting,
it fit amazingly,
my son had to wear this to perform a dance routine and it didn’t rip or tear,
"great quality and true to size, i ordered it for my wedding and i can't wait to wear it",
all of my groomsmen are getting this shirt,
id reccomend it and buy it again,
gave out as gift and he loved it,
great quality and feel for the price,
looks sharp with jeans or slacks,
very good shirt for price,
great for the price,
"fits nicely, looks great",
size chart m is loose for an average body,
but seems to be a very well made shirt,
this shirt is great material,
"however, i listened to the reviews and ordered a size too big",
the reviews lied,
so now i've spent $20 on a shirt that i can't wear because it's huge,
would really like to know if i can exchange it,
i'm disappointed because it is a very nice shirt,
i did not even open the package because ai didn't care for the fabric,
great quality and great value,
just as the picture,
good quality,
i will order different colors,
shirt fits good,
its soft,
and is good for the price,
i hope it would be a atheltic fit it wasnt very disappointed,
this product was worn at a middle school semi-formal dance,
too baggy for what i usually buy,
but nice quality a even though the fabrics a little too stiff,
the medium was too tight,
seller is sending a large one free of charge,
thx,
the picture appears to have the shirt sides pinned in the back to give it a slim look,
"i am 6-foot, 170-lbs and",
"while the arms and neck are perfect, the body of the shirt is not form fitting at all",
love the quality and texture,
not a true-slim fit,
loved the way it fit my husband,
if your a large go a size bigger,
it was nice and lightweight,
the person who received this shirt says it has a nice feel and fits well,
"sizing chart says xl 36/37 sleeves,",
however they're shorter than my shirts with 34/35 sleeves,
"on the ""up"" side they are slim fit, and the material is nice",
"my grandson did not like the material other then that it fit perfect, had to give to his father",
worked well for the one time being worn,
ok,
gift for husband,
he really likes the fit,
fits like the size it’s says seems to be good quality looks good too,
"surprisingly cheap for how comfortable it is, looks very nice, very bright white",
but then again maybe i was flexing too much,
"great shirt, soft and breathes well",
"nice tailored look, fits true to size",
great fit and feel,
totally worth for it's price,
fits as expected,
i'm not big,
but wow was this small,
worn for a wedding,
bought normal shirt size and if fit perfect,
wasn't 'slim fit' as expected,
also came at least a size too large,
"material is thin and translucent,",
but that's on par for a shirt this cheap,
really nice shirt,
but the sleeves were too short,
"i roll them up and it works out for a casual look,",
but i can't wear it with a suit,
perfect fit,
nice shirt,
"my husband is very picky with his shirts, he loved this one it fit him perfect",
great fit cool style,
very nice,
the shirt is too long to wear untucked,
had tailor take up length by two inches,
great quality,
nice,
came in nice time just in time for my bday vacation,
nice made nice fit,
and nice material,
excited in shopping again,
"nice looking dress shirt, unfortunately the size is more a men's m than a men's xl",
hard to iron even with a steamer doesn't look all ok,
please read the description carefully,
the cloth is so soft and you can see your skin underneath,
love it,
i used this shirt for a photoshoot on the beach of my me and fiance's engagement and the shirt fit like a glove,
good material that breathed well and nice pattern,
he loved and and i loved it on him even more,
no,
great and stylish shirt for the price,
my husband is 5'8 178 lbs i got him a large,
"perfect fit, great quality",
really slim will be so nice,
the shirt is so nice,
"i weigh 186 with broad shoulders and 34"" waist",
the large fit me perfect,
"if you don't like clothes that fit really snug, get the xl",
these shirts suck,
i’m 5’5,
"average build, broad chest and 31 waist",
normally i take a medium slim fit,
"i guess you get what you pay for,",
"but in this case,  i didn’t because i sent it right back",
not your boyfriends shirt anymore,
comfortable material and fit,
not too snug,
but tapered nicely,
it’s ok,
great,
wasn't very slim fitting,
on top of that it wasn't long enough to tuck in properly,
raising arms would undo shirt,
fabric over all was pretty gross,
apparent i'm going to have to pay for than 20 bucks for something decent,
this item arrived just in time,
and fit perfectly,
great shirt and fits true to size,
i stuck with my normal size and it is perfect,
personally don’t need to wear until labor day weekend,
but looks like the right size,
i read other reviews for size before buying,
"i bought xl, i’m 6’2”, 185 pounds",
this shirt fits great and i will buy more in other colors,
"very comfortable, the fabric is slightly itchy though",
really nice sturdy collar,
"perfect fit, great material, great quality",
i'm buying every color they have,
wish there were more options,
"the shirt is nice,",
but too small in every dimension,
felt like a small when i ordered a medium,
also had a strange discoloration in the back,
perhaps they were drinking coffee when they made the shirt,
the material is fine though,
very nice material and fit well,
it's fit good,
but could be a little longer,
good fabric,
"quality, color, and texture nice",
nice shirt for the price,
great shirt,
great fit great quality,
excellent buy,
"i wouldn't call the shirt slim, and it's not near as crisp as it looks in the photo",
"however, for the price, it's a decent dress shirt",
great,
"es muy mala calidad no es una camisa fina ,no me gusto para nada",
great material,
good fit,
nice fabric fits perfect,
its good,
"quality isnt super high,",
but for the price it gets a pass,
nice,
good,
me encanta,
only reason i gave four out of five is that the arms are just a touch bit too short,
fantastic shirt otherwise,
i bought this for my brother and he loved it,
the size and everything was as expected,
when i took the shirt out the package i had to do a double take because the smell that came from the shirt was simply unbearable,
"it literally smelled like dead fish smh,",
good quality,
very comfortable shirt :,
very nice,
very good quality for the price,
i’m very very happy with this product,
i bought this for my fiancé for our wedding and it came suuper quick and it looks amazing,
great fit for muscular build,
the color wasn’t white white,
but it worked non the less,
"my favorite dress shirt, best value on any shirt i owned",
only problem is i want more colors offered,
"not impressed with myself for not looking at how to clean, its dry clean",
dressing up,
"decent quality,",
but fit more like a men’s large rather than xl,
"nice shirt, fits as expected",
"collar size was huge, everything else fine, i should’ve return it cause i’m not even going to wear it",
this shirt is fake,
"i ordered a small, it came in a 42 which is not even a medium size",
it is way too large,
false advertising,
not slim fit one bit,
great fit,
the circumference of the sleeves are a little on the small side,
otherwise it’s a great fit,
neck seemed way bigger in proportion to the sleeves and chest fit,
had to return since i wear ties and it looked bad,
no big deal,
wore it a few times and washed it,
"cold water, air dry in a dryer",
it shrunk to the point it is unwearable,
very disapointed and will not buy another,
perfect for cosplay or everyday wear,
perfect,
the shirt size was xlarge,
"but it was too small for an adult man, moreless it could fit a teenager",
small,
nice build and quality,
"only problem is the size, too small for me",
the material is not too thick yet i believe it's great for the fall,
don't know if i would buy this again for the price,
this was not a slum cut shirt at all,
"nice quality shirt, washes up well",
not as slim fit as i would have preferred at waist,
bought extra large fit like a medium,
i was looking for a fitted dress shirt with darts in the back so that the shirt would be tapered along the back and waist,
the back pic of this shirt indicated that there were darts and the description indicated it would be a slim fit,
disappointed,
perfect fit,
just what i expected,
great material and fit,
but sadly had a stain on the sleeve so waiting for a replacement,
my hubby look great in this shirt,
i like it,
had to tailor them to fit my slim sons,
definitely not slim fit,
xl fits like a medium,
high quality,
great quality purchased his size and fits perfect,
"not got quality arms were supper tight, ripped on me first time ware",
didn’t wear xl is not really xl buy a size bigger,
a work shirt,
"short, terrible neck fit, short sleeves, not a great shirt",
i just reordered the same shirts as before,
but the sizing was different and too small,
the shirt is awesome,
got what i expected would order from them again,
material feels like paper,
low low quality,
way too slim for the size,
order sizes larger than you actually need,
the shirt itself is of nice quality,
generally fits well except neck,
fits well and great fabric,
fit is not close to what they say,
great value,
size is too small,
shoulder area is pretty tight for the neck and arm length,
otherwise fit great,
it fits great,
small fit,
the shirt color is too bright,
great,
small,
"awesome shirt, fits good",
awesome striped design,
small and poor material,
too tight in waist,
shirt has a white striping that was not in picture or description,
shirt way too small my arms won’t even fit in it,
the worst size chart,
zero stars,
"when i opened the outer package, it looked as though the shirt was dirty",
i proceeded to open the sealed inner package and discovered the “dirt” was actually mold,
nice material,
but runs small,
i am 6’ 190 and it’s tight a tight across the chest and back in a large,
"also, a little short as there’s not much extra material to keep it tucked in",
"my son likes slim fitted shirts, and he looked real good in this shirt",
i don't like the fact that i have to wash it and iron it,
"ordered a medium, looks more like an xs",
size up 2 sizes for proper fit,
very small,
i'd order up maybe 4 sizes,
waste of $$,
poor sizing chart,
returned product immediately,
its a very nice shirt,
but i got the smallest size and it came pretty big,
nice shirt for the money,
fits as expected,
looks sharp,
fits as expected,
i knew it might be slightly big on my son,
he is in the last leg of kids clothes and the first stage of men sizes,
thought this slim fit shirt would be my fitted,
either wat he likes it,
but i would've preferred a closer fit because it's going under a suit,
i'm satisfied though,
one of the best shirts i've bought on amazon,
loved it so much i got it in 4 colors,
a friend of mine brought me this shirt for my light yagami cosplay and it fits perfectly,
it’s not too big a d it’s not too small,
everything from the neck to the waist fits as expected,
"i’m 5’4 and 117lbs so he ordered me a small,",
but it feels as if this shirt was tailored specifically for me,
10/10,
very nice shirt,
no issues at all  nice buy  for sure,
perfecto,
it is so soft and comfortable,
got it for cosplay and love it,
very nice looking shirt,
high quality fabric,
looks very fancy,
i approve,
perfect,
exactly as described,
not too long either,
i’m a woman and purchased this for myself as i like the over-sized look,
"i figured since it’s a ‘slim fit’ it wouldn’t be too big, which i was definitely correct",
"it’s a very nice, soft shirt",
"however, not like your typical cotton dress shirts",
it’s a little thicker,
"probably great for sweaty guys so it doesn’t show,",
but i found it made me hotter,
"eitherwise, it is definitely a slim fit, and fit my frame",
i’m 5’8”,
"i was surprised by the item, not buying men's clothing online prior",
"my husband normally buys a large because his neck is wider than a medium allows comfortably,",
but he had switched the size to medium without my knowledge and the shirt fit wonderfully,
it fit to his body without excess material around the back and arms,
while having good space in the collar for him,
"having been losing weight, his belly is a wee rounder than his frame normally would have,",
but the shirt fit without being tight there and would stay a nice shirt once slimmed properly,
so to say it fit as expected is rather spot on,
"needed a medium, fit into a medium",
i ordered a large as i read that these fit small,
but that was not the case,
i ordered my normal size,
and it fit much better,
feels higher quality than those cheap mall store brand,
"it is very good product, i bought medium light blue aize 42 , it is a liiiitle tight because i am a little chubby now",
i should loose my weight i am 94 kilo 175 cm,
i am going to order another with one size bigger,
and i will keep this one,
the quality is soft when you touch it  and slim,
not super slim that i dont like it,
it is little thick in good way,
i dont like some when you wear your body skin be visible,
i recommand to buy it if you are not sure,
but make sure your size,
i bought this for my harry potter costume,
i am a women and bought a small and it fits perfectly,
"very good quality, it's really long on me tho, keep that in mind",
i'm tucking it in anyways :,
this is a really great shirt super great material,
could have used a little more work on the stitching some of the stitching was coming out,
but all in all it was a great shirt,
unfortunately we gave it to our friend because my fiance did not fit it,
there should be more sizes available extra large was not big enough,
durable fabric,
stain was on the shirt upon arrival,
but seller sent me another perfect one,
situation remedied and did not need escalation,
great shirt,
fit my son perfectly,
belle chemise mais faite très très petite,
nice clean good,
"not at all what i was expecting, very disappointed with the shirt overall",
very nice,
"bought a m true to size - all reviews are accurate, high quality material &amp",
detail on this dress shirt,
great buy,
very good,
"super comfy, everything was good",
but the sleeves were way too small,
fits well,
seems like good material,
time will tell,
will buy in another colour,
"i just got it and i found a cut on it, very poor quality",
the arms where a little too big,
i like it when the arms of a shirt are a little tight,
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻,
it is a great fit,
great fit,
nice purchase,
beau produit,
le produit n'est pas slim fit et ne ressemble en rien à l'article sur la photo,
not slim fit,
bad,
