1.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I first noticed these shirts at a country concert in october 2019 in el paso. Seemed like everyone was wearing it. I must have been missing the new ""it thing"". It caught my attention when I saw the words along the sleeve of a shirt. Which are my favorite kind of shirts. I hate when a customer has to pay for a $40 t shirt that just has a logo in the small upper corner of the shirt. No design. Example: those Marc Ecko shirts with the rhino design printed on the front. We had to pay $40 to $50 dollars for a shirt with little detail. Anyway the reason I gave it 1 Star is because the shirts were huge and over sized. I even got a small and it was still over-big. The shirts fit like those basic scrubs that are shaped like squares.  The bigger the size a person gets, the more square it gets. Doesnt get longer at the end of the shirt. It's a new day in age where people wear their cloths fitted. Or brands of dress shirts have a fitted version on the shirt.  Seems like the brand Ariat is made for people with huge stomachs. And they wanna keep it that way. Because they only want a certain type of people to wear their cloths. Now that I mention it, it's so obvious. Now I know why people make their own brands. Sorry this turned into a rant instead of a review. Someone please steal my idea a d make a brand where the logo uses the sleeve and other parts of the shirt. That would be the theme. Clever I know. Lmfao..

  This shirt was a gift for my big brother who apparently wears clothes beyond my price range because this shirt ain't cheap!

  I love the shirt, I’m fat but i had forgotten on ariat dress shirts like this i fit good on a large and I wasn’t paying attention and bought an XL, and it was just way too big and I’m 5’6 about 207 if your about my size get a large.

  Super Hemd passt wie erwartet hervorragend. Verkäufer ist super nett und hilfsbereit. Beantwortet fragen schnell und kümmert sich bei Problemen. Da könnten sich Firmen aus Deutschland eine Scheibe von abschneiden. Antworten innerhalb von ein paar Stunden selbst am Wochenende. Super immer gern wieder
