  The only thing amazing about this shirt is that anyone actually buys the BS that this is 100% Cotton‚Äî it‚Äôs absolutely not‚Äî it‚Äôs that horrible wicking fiber junk‚Äî those shirts are wonderful the first time you put them on, hey I used to fall for them too.  Very comfortable on the first few outings‚Äî but then as they wear the plastic that they are made out of starts to make itself known and no matter how much you wash it if you sweat it in the smell is never coming out.<br><br>They also run big‚ÄîI bought a large (and I returned it) and this was big enough for a guy carrying an extra 80lbs.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10‚Äù 180lbs‚Äî I‚Äôd go with a M if you‚Äôre the same size and you don‚Äôt mind these fake man made material shirts.<br><br>The best option is high quality cotton shirts ‚Äî light weave.  There are several out there, Banana Republic has one‚Äî they also have the bad micro fiber shirts so beware.  It‚Äôs also shameful that they list this as 100% Cotton when it‚Äôs clearly not.

  This shirt is made of a wonderfully soft, silky cotton. BUT it has a large cloth tag in the neck that can't be removed (it's very securely GLUED to the cloth) and is very stiff and itchy. In addition, two shoulder seams that join the collar are sewn with some synthetic material that also itches. Weirdly, I bought a second shirt from Calvin Klein at the same time (different color) and it has TWO neck tags, sewn in, which I was able to remove without damage to the shirt, and the shoulder seams are not annoying. I guess their quality control stinks, and they haven't cught up to the rest of the world in placing PRINTED neck tags in their shirts (I thought everybody was doing that). I wouldn't buy these shirts again, and I'll have to be assured that the neck tags are printed in any shirt I buy from now on.

  Really nice material. Much nicer than expected. Ck logo is small and really not noticeable. Got this to wear on casual date nights and summer evening and have been getting lots of compliments. Like many ck products, it‚Äôs tight Around the arms (I‚Äôm 6‚Äô 210 with a formerly athletic build so struggle to find good fits but with the exception of the arms, this fits really well. Got the white one with grey stripes and have paired it with jeans, blue shorts and grey shorts and all have looked good.

  I have been wearing Calvin Klein polo shirts for over 10 years.  I normally purchase the shirts directly from Calvin Klein.  I love the cut and the fit of their shirts.  For what ever reason the cut of this shirt is different from other Calvin polo's I own.  The fit is great.  The weight of the shirt is very nice.  The cut of the shirt is just a little different. Also the collar has a mind of its own.

  I was drawn to these Polo shirts because they come in a large variety of colors. I was an avid collector! I wash them on delicate cycle and line dry them.  The colors are  beautiful and stay vibrant after many many washes.<br>The interlock fabric is soft and has an elegant appearance. Sadly, I've noticed that some of the shirts are now showing tiny holes in random places after only several washes. They quickly get bigger and the stitches start running. It can't really be fixed.  I am very disappointed. I often bought two of the same color, so it will probably happen to those also. How can it be, that some are holding up perfectly and others are just terrible. I wonder if some of these shirts are second rate quality.

  Found this Polo at a Calvin Klein outlet a year ago. Have been looking all over for more. Husband loves this for golf as it‚Äôs so comfortable, lightweight but does not cling. Perfect fit. Washes well. Keeps its shape.

  The material is very soft and feels great, however, I wish there was some degree of taper to the waist. The shirt is very boxy. That's not an issue if that is how you prefer yours, however, if you're looking for something that comes in a little as it goes down from the shoulders, this is not the fit you'll find in this shirt.

  As a wife I thought the shirt was a perfect fit for my husband. He stated that he wished it was a little longer he felt it was to short at the bottom and a little tighter than what he's used to. I felt that he was just a little uncomfortable with having a bigger stomach. I didn't have him raise his hands to see if it would lift and show anything but my experience I think it would have. I would probably go up one size for this.
"

  Great comfortable shirt . Love the material. Similar to under armour polo. Calvin Klein RUNS SMALL! I am six feet tall 180 lbs. I am wearing a XL and it fits perfect. I have broad shoulders. I would suggest buying a size up unless you like your shirts butt tight. Secondly machine wash cold and hang dry. Don't put these in the dryer if you can avoid it.

  I love CK and specifically the liquid touch polos, but this one had little holes in the front bottom after just a few weeks - just after the return window closed. Very disappointing. It is not moths as this is the only item in my closet this happened to and I don't do anything unsual while wearing it.

  Love these polos, good fit and design. Fit is as expected. So many polo shirts have bad collars and these look great. I'm glad they come in multiple colors, including some interesting contrasting collar looks. I will be stocking up a bit!
"

  These are great polos if you buy them in stores but I ordered 2 from Amazon and they both came with terribly creased collars. I have tried steaming and ironing and nothing works to fix the permanent crease in the collars. Aside from that, they are decent polos, fit nice on the arms but are not to tight around the body, which is how I like my polos. But I would avoid buying these online. Really disappointed.

  This is literally the first negative review I've ever wrote on Amazon. I am 5'11"", 160 lbs. I purchased the large and it barely goes past my waistline. And it's very wide. It would be a great fit for a short husky guy, but unwearable for me. Unfortunately I took the tags off so I can't return it.
