we purchase of these shirt for my son,1
all the same brand all the same size all from amazon,0
but do review on each color because they do differ,0
i don ’ t know if everyone be like me or not,0
but heavily rely on product review when place online order,0
purchase of white,0
run really big,2
my son start new job at one of the chain hardware store,0
they require that he wear collared shirt,0
he didn ’ t have any and be that he work in the garden center know they would get dirty and didn ’ t want to spend lot,0
we order of these shirt from the same brand,0
this particular one be white,0
i be not very happy with this one,1
the material be super thin and it be scratchy,2
you can almost see through it,0
but it work ok because he wear vest over the shirt at work,0
i will say on positive note though the shirt have get pretty dirty and have clean up well,1
for,1
probably wouldn ’ t buy again will wait for sale at one of the department store and get good soft quality shirt,1
,1
purchase of ash grey,0
run pretty true to size,0
as mention in my other shirt review my son be require to wear collared shirt at work,0
be that he work in hardware store we know they would get dirty and didn ’ t want to spend lot,0
we order of these shirt from the same brand,0
this particular one be grey,0
out of the we purchase this one be far the best,1
it be make of thicker material than the white one,0
it be way soft than the white one and it fit more true to size than the white one,0
it have always amaze me how you can buy multiple item from the same seller and they fit differently,1
he wear this one the most,0
even on day when he get it super dirty it wash up easily without even use prewashstain remover,0
i be happy with this one consider the price we pay,1
,1
purchase of charcoal,1
run bit big,2
this review be for the charcoal color shirt,0
the shirt be nice dark color which help keep it clean,1
i be concern about the shirt be too hot,0
as mention in my other shirt review my son work at hardware store in the garden center and be outside lot,0
the shirt be lightweight and thin so he hasn ’ t get too warm in it,0
be that the color be dark the fact that it be thin be not big issue like it be with the white one,2
much like the white shirt the material on this one be bite scratchy,0
it ’ s be wash several time and still have that scratchy feeling,2
also much like the white one this one tend to run bit large than regular xl shirt,2
we have be rotate the shirt during his weekly schedule,0
although they may not be my favorite purchase or even really great “ deal ” wouldn ’ t return them,0
all shirt despite their difference have hold up well and be good work shirt,1
this time of year you dont need sweater in mississippi yet,0
but long sleeve be must,0
i be look online for some costeffective longsleeve shirt that could easily wear for business casual and casual,0
this be perfect,1
it look good with slack or jean,1
look and feel good,1
the fabric be little light compare to the heavy cotton that be often use in such shirt,0
but it be good,1
when they say they will deliver xl they mean business,0
i be big guy and need the big size,2
but this shirt have that cover,0
these be awesome,1
first and foremost it be jersey knit not polo knit so it feel like light weight tee shirt which be awesome in the summer time,1
i work combination of indoors and outdoors so tee shirt with collar be real plus around my office,0
the fit be amaze,1
im build like fire plug,0
and lb,0
i have chest,0
but normally wear coat for my shoulder,0
well the xl be perfect fit for me,1
a large fit me good across the chest and be more form fitting,1
its snug,0
but not tight,2
but the xl fit my shoulder and be lot more comfortable,1
in my opinion the sizing be spot on accurate,2
from the jerzees website xl,0
even good than the way it fit in the chest be the sleeve,2
they go all the way to my elbow,2
a standard polo sleve bunch up and creep up to my shoulder,0
this shirt have roomy shoulder so it doesnt bunch up and the sleeve go all the way to my elbow,2
straight arm it stop about,0
above the crease in my inner elbow,0
lastly be the length,0
at can tuck this shirt in into my jean or slack and it look great,1
most polo shirt in an xl be either way too long,2
hang past my crotch,0
or way too short,2
stop at my belt,0
this one be design to be wear tuck in,0
if you be tall than foot id look at the tall size,0
if youre heavier,0
thicker in the middle,0
look at the numbered size,0
a secret to shirt size that many dont know be that an xxl and be not the same cut,0
in football term an xxl be for run back,0
while be for lineman,0
if youre stocky in the middle get the numbered size,0
if youre big guy with vback,0
narrow waist,0
then go for the multiple sizing,0
for wash,0
the tag say machine wash and machine dry,0
personally just toss them in the machine on cold and then dry them on low to about half way,2
minute on low heat,2
then hang dry them the rest of the way so they dont shrink,2
theyre not suppose to shrink since theyre poly,2
but it be still knit shirt,0
need green shirt for work,0
i ’ m ’ weigh at so do order medium be that men clothe run big than woman,0
i wear thin neck shirt under so it do fit snug like medium should,0
i think the shirt be great,1
it fit me perfect,1
i be regular medium,0
’ ” lb,0
the length be right for my height get the navy blue and look great with jean or chino,1
i do not see anything cheap about it and like their hoodies too,2
i buy these as cheap replacement for my old all cotton shirt by another company altogether,2
they do seem cheap,2
firstly they have strong chemical odor not usually associate with cottonpolyester,0
at least not in my experience,2
secondly they be very thin,0
the material be light in weight,1
they may do after wash,0
i get them not minute ago,2
and we will have to see,0
the one thing that be afraid of be the material may be actually more polyester than cotton,2
it be suppose to be,0
but really dont think so,0
i be rely on my experience in clothing and my first visual impression to make that statement,0
i be not expect much,2
will update in few month,0
if they last that long,0
hr later wash etc they do fluff miniscule amount,0
i notice that when take them from the washer they be almost dry to the touch which lead me to believe less cotton,0
more polyester,0
like that the collar do not get permanent crease,2
armhole be good size for men with muscle,1
my husband usually complain they be too tight,0
but he like these,1
length be perfect for average man,1
husband say that the stistitching on the bottom edge be very nice,1
have be wash multiple time color be still intact,0
material doesnt pick,1
shirt be use for work manual labor get dirty etc,0
not desk job,2
but look nice too so it would still be nice for office,1
dry fairly quickly when he get wet,0
not bad wrinkle shirt very good wash and wear be polycotton,2
will be orderung good deal more of these,1
be hesitant at first when it arrive,0
the shirt be never wear amp,0
its already rip at seam,2
we wash it per the washing instruction amp,0
the first time it be put on we notice the rip,2
poor quality and not well make,2
it fit great guess you get what you pay for,1
if you have dog that shed please be forewarn that this shirt will collect every single dog hair in the dryer,0
every,1
single,1
one,1
polyester it will come out look like your animal be attach to it somehow,2
i have to spend ten minute,0
not exaggerate,0
remove dog hair with both lint brush and lint sticky roller,0
the shirt be great and fit great and wash well with no fading and wrinkling,1
but it be not pet hair friendly,2
everyone else knock yourself out because it be great shirt,1
wont be order any more of these,0
any food that get on them leave stain that never come out,2
ive never have shirt stain so easily,0
if you spill drink on it it bead up and roll off which be cool,0
but any kind of sauce oil anything with fat will instantly and permanently bond to the shirt,0
on the plus side they fit great and look nice,1
fabric be thin and cool,2
i wear them every day as work shirt,0
but cant be replace them constantly because get little dribble of salad dress on them,2
these be essentially long sleeve shirt with collar,0
the material be extremely thin,2
i expect them to be thick similar to some jerzees shirt have,0
however the fit be excellent on me so keep them,1
don ’ t count on them keep you very warm though,1
if it ’ s ultralight weight you ’ re look for these be perfect,1
they should breathe well,1
i ’ m ’ lb with an athletic build and xl fit good,1
update after wash these,0
with cheer color guard only,0
the material actually get thicker and soft feeling and the shirt be quite comfortable,1
i ’ m wear it right now for the first time,0
the cuff be extremely soft and luxurious feeling and the shirt be nice and soft to the touch moreso than expect,1
it ’ s in the low ’ s right now in chicago and the shirt be perfect,1
for me,1
it ’ s still rather thin material for long sleeve shirt,2
thus the economical price,1
but it ’ s perfect for wear around the house with short or as layer under jacket or warm sweater when the temp drop to the low ’ s tonight,0
the material have nice stretchiness to it,1
but think it ’ s in the weave and not the material which be cottonpolyester no mention of the common lycra,2
it didn ’ t shrink much if at all in the wash,0
they advertise that it ’ s preshrunk and i ’ d agree and the length both shirt and sleeve for xl be plentiful for me at ’ ”,0
often the arm shrink and end up little short on me unless go up size so this be nice surprise,2
jerzees didn ’ t skimp on the amount of albeit thin material,0
this polo be well worth the price on amazon,1
i find myself struggle most morning to put an outfit together for work my solution create uniform,0
they be durable and machine washable which add an extra layer of convenience and they go well with sport jacket make them versatile,1
and inexpensive,1
addition to your corporate wardrobe,0
super thin material,0
see my photo show how see through this be,0
thank god buy white tshirt for underneath,1
this be for my yo son who have little weight issue,0
he need it for orchestra concert tomorrow so i ’ m stuck with it and hope the tshirt be good barrier,0
so if you ’ re not perfectly rip and don ’ t want people to see your moobs or belly don ’ t buy this shirt,0
this be my second shirt from this style,1
i get blue one and like it lot now have color choice,1
originally want long sleeve protection when do outdoor community outreach project for club,0
for that purpose it be excellent,1
it turn out to be stylish enough to wear to casual nice activity like meal with family,1
i usually end up wear my lunch,0
yesterday blob of dress from sandwich wipe right off and the shirt come through the wash with no spot,0
good stain protection and no wrinkle from the dryer,1
fit be as expect,1
just right for my xxl torso,1
and finish quality be good,1
very happy with this shirt,1
you maybe look at this shirt because you want to wear it for work or for everyday,1
it will totally work for both,1
but need halloween costume,0
so purchase it size too big and go felicia from the movie friday,0
the color and size be as expect,1
but the shirt be pretty thin,0
it wrinkle pretty easily,1
it be good for summer,1
the issue usually have with polo be,0
the collar,0
the sleeve,0
the length,1
the collar on this one be ok,0
over time though because it be thin expect it will roll up at the end which be annoy,0
the sleeve on this be odd which may be because of the thinness,0
where the band on the end of the sleeve be sew to the sleeve it be very pronounced,0
it make it just kind of look odd,2
time will tell on the length,1
what see usually happen be that the back of the shirt will shrink up and the front wont,2
which make it wearable only if you tuck it in,0
otherwise it get boxy look,1
i expect this one will do that,1
but so far its ok,1
overall be hop for solid cheap polo and be plan to buy several more,1
glad wait and only get one to try out because my search continue,0
strange feel for cottonpoly mix,0
the shirt be very scratchy to the point of irritation especially around the collar,0
the sleeve be ultratight at the wrist,0
and the general shape be american i,0
small in the chest big in the belly,2
i originally think all the color variation be great feature,1
but would not buy this shirt again after purchase just one,2
you get what you pay for definitely hold true on this one,1
i buy this for myself,1
im lb woman stand,0
i want long sleeve and couldnt find this shirt in the woman dept,0
i be amaze at how good the top fit in xl,1
the sleeve be nice and long and the material be cotton blend which make it lightweight,1
the length of the body be long so if youre long waisted this will fit,0
its almost too long for me as it come down to the top of my thigh,2
great product id definitely purchase this again,1
the product be of high quality and as advertised,1
the vendor deliver timely well package and perform as advertised,1
i would highly recommend both the vendor and the product,1
i be look for decent golf shirt at good price,1
the price,1
,1
seem to be tremendous bargain especially give the very positive review,0
so ordered one to try,0
sizing be not an issue,2
the problem be the material be so flimsy its almost transparent,2
in part may have be because order white,0
i try to return it through amazon,2
but get message that it wasnt allow,0
so donate the shirt to charity,0
darker color may be good choice,1
i think some may like this shirt,1
but it wasnt what expect,1
my apology to jerzees,0
i get my shirt mix up and say some thing in my original review that werent true,0
what follow be the updated accurate assessment of their shirt,0
i also up the rating to star as feel be appropriate,0
i order the kelly green polo,0
but their color palatte be off,1
it be too brightfluorescent to be consider true kelly green so im disappointed about that,0
but thats about all im disappoint with,0
i have to say that the shirt be constructedstitched in quality manner and sizewise it fit as expect and its not like the shirt look disgustingly horrible or anything,2
despite the off color,1
for under its really not all that bad of shirt,2
ive pay lot more for lot bad in the past,2
and it represent great value in men clothe,1
quality make,1
but feel it be touch smallish,0
no problem always order size large for t and polo as like long tail to tuck in,0
these arent cotton,0
but be very comfortable anyway once wash,1
have little bit of synthetic fiber help keep their shape and seem to make them last longer,2
couple with its low price feel this be bargain,1
all in all very happy,1
the shirt come quickly and it look and feels very nice for the price,1
i generally wear size xl,0
but this particular shirt in xl be much too large so exchange it for size l,2
the cottonpolyester blend be definitely superior to cotton,0
this shirt can be use as uniform attire or even business casual attire if you throw on some slack,2
i wish these come in wider array of color other than that im very happy with this purchase,1
it be not bad product it just have some flaw,2
the sizing of this shirt run bit large except in the sleeve diameter below the elbow,2
when you look at this do you note the banded cuff these be fairly small and the diameter of the sleeve below the elbow be fairly small as well,2
i live in the south where it rarely get very cold,0
it be important to be able to adjust warmth as the day progress by shed layer and or roll up sleeve,0
that be the major problem with this shirt,0
it be difficult to push the sleeve up and expose forearm,0
i do grab the cuff and the low sleeve and pull until it stretch out bit,2
i be then able to push them up some,0
but not as far of as comfortably as would like,2
i order these for my son because he have to wear uniform to school,0
they be very well make and comfortable,1
i order size big than my son usually wear because uniform shirt normally run small and my son be the size of grown man,2
they be little too big,2
but they be wearable,0
the way my son be grow that might not be such bad thing,2
these shirt be true to size so dont order size up or size down,0
unfortunately due to the coronavirus pandemic change my mind and end up have my son not go to school and participate in remote learning so he will never get to wear them to school this year,0
hopefully next year he will have to wear the same color as this year and he can use them in the grade,0
i make him wear it during school hour during remote learning when he be in class meeting on camera,0
i be glad that only order two,0
but get them for great price,1
i be very happy customer and definitely recommend these shirt to everyone,1
i wish it be easy to find shirt like this for woman that didnt cost as much,1
i usually wear an xl so order l because it be men,0
it fit just little big than id like,2
but figure it might shrink over time,1
i wear this shirt for work and need something that wouldnt stain and would wash and dry well,0
it also need to hold up to repeat washing since wash my work clothes after every shift,1
i also get coffee mocha sauce etc on me at work and so far this shirt be hold up great,1
good value for the price,1
i order black large and it be huge,0
at it be not go to shrink so exchanged it for medium and the color to gray,0
the replacement be way too small and the weight of the fabric be far less,2
i give up,0
it be just too much trouble buy thing on line,1
now cant leave because of the virus,0
this one will go in the goodwill box,0
you absolutely can not beat the price,1
this be tee shirt weight not quite as soft as tee shirt,0
but not rough by any mean,2
the fit be not too baggy,2
but definitely big and square enough to fit big guy,2
i be foot and pound with broad shoulder,0
not sure how it would do if you have big belly,2
but have regular size waist and the shirt fit me fine,0
great for wear when tee shirt be too informal,1
but you dont want to dress up any more,0
i order four these shirt in four different color,0
i order large which be normally bit big on me,0
but good fit than medium,1
with these shirt the large be bit small not small enough to return,2
but little small than have come to expect from men large,2
the shirt be comfortable,1
but bit thin,2
i have only have them for couple washing so do not know how they will hold up long term,0
as thin as they be be concerned,0
time will tell,1
overall for the price they be great shirt,1
if they hold up well will buy again,1
i need this for that day friday where we be to wear polo shirt and jean,0
i dont really wear polo shirt so wasnt look to spend lot of money on them,2
i be write this review in august have buy it the previous december,0
its fairly comfy and the fit be right,1
it fit little loose,2
but doesnt hang off me it hang down just the right length in my opinion,0
have run it through the wash many time now can say it doesnt appear to have fade and the stitching isnt fall apart either,2
honestly for what you pay for these consider that to be pretty good,1
i wear large size short sleeve version and think xl would be good fit the long sleeve it wasnt,0
nice shirt for the price,1
not crazy about the white shirt,2
blue,0
navyelectric,0
maroon black pink green look great and even wear good,1
i really dont like to write review that be not positive,2
but must on this one in that feel can prevent nonpositive reaction when you receive yours,0
i want something inexpensive,1
but decent look for my husband an artist to wear on daily basis,0
this be about the most unattractive shirt in everyway that can think of,0
it be flimsy its color be dull it look like they take to piece cut out the outline and sew them together,0
thats not what they do,0
but the shirt sure look like it,1
i be so offended that go through the entire return process even though they be quite inexpensive,2
at,1
it be not worth it,2
these polo shirt fit very nicely,1
i have broad shoulder and moderately muscle chest,0
i find often that shirt that fit my chest and shoulder be then too big around the waist and too long,0
these jerzees polo be the exception at they fit me well in all area and add to slimming appearance,1
i buy these as something akin to uniform for my massage business work,0
the chest and shoulder fit be trim enough to accentuate my torso shape and roomy enough to accommodate my reaching and lifting of client during my work,0
i will order more too as like these as everyday wear good than just tshirts,1
fit as expect and great quality garment at this price point,1
i work in industrial sale love these shirt because dont feel guilty when get grease on them or catch the corner of machine and put hole in it,1
the stain guard be double edged sword,0
they dont stain easy this be true even after several wash the liquid just bead up and roll off without penetrate the fabric this be also the downside for me,2
the shirt dont adsorb sweat at all,0
the sweat rather stay on your skin and leave icky feeling as it bead and roll off your back,2
ive notice after or so wash its better,0
but still not super comfortable in hot humid environment,0
im force to wear undershirt under these more layer hotter,0
but help absorb sweat,0
need shirt for work that be black polo and comfortable,1
normally when order shirt they be make of some sort of sweaty blend of fabric which make it horrible to wear and hot,0
not this bad boy,2
this be cotton comfortable professional,1
but im not suffer the dreaded itchy fabric blue,0
a shirt that say be professional,0
but im not itchy,0
im five foot one female and weigh lb carry most of my weight in my midsection,0
i have to return the woman size large polo shirt in lieu of the men medium,2
they fit perfect,1
and love the california blue because it be more teal then it be turquoise,1
they wash and wear very well,1
i take them out of the dryer after the cool down cycle and there be very few wrinkle,0
not even enough to iron,2
they dont seem to have shrunk either since they be polyester and cotton,0
ive be search for the right shirt for our adult team mentor for over year,0
and from the feedback think id try this one,0
this shirt be excellent,1
the fabric be super soft for wear and yet the shape and fabric be stable,0
no wrinkle after hour of wear look as fresh and new as when it come,2
wash up like new,1
i wash one of the we purchase and could not tell which one be wash compare to the others it retain the same fit and same quality as the notyetwashed,0
for those who want to know it be also the right fabric for an embroidered logo,0
many shirt weave be too loose or too tight distort the logo after its stitch on,2
or after wash the shirt the logo be too loose on the tight shrunk fabric,2
the aspect be my big concern when purchase them would this shirt work great for stitched logo we take it to our embroiderer and the resultant logo be crisp clean not distort,0
in word perfect,1
even after wash multiple time,2
the background fabric be major component to achieve beautiful logo,1
this shirt exceed my expectation,1
for fit compare the medium to the large and the difference be extra inch on either shoulder and long,0
the shirt be not taper and fit the adult body that be not quite as slim as heshe use to be perfectly,0
if you be waver in size between and if the person be skinny pick the it will fit without the bulk of extra fabric around the waist,0
ill be back for more short as our team expands,2
very happy,1
i feel review be super important to help other online shopper,0
with that be say read review of this shirt and it be highly rat so decided to purchase two in white,0
however when my order arrive be extremely disappointed with the material quality,2
these shirt be super thin and you can see through them,0
my son try one on and you could see the color of his nipple through them,0
very disappointed since have other jerzees shirt and have be happy with them,1
this be fine shirt,1
it look good it fit well it seem to hold up to repeat washing,1
the navy color be very close to whats picture and the fabric feel well than what you expect from poly blend,1
however there be very strong chemical smell that have persist through multiple washing,0
maybe its fire retardant coating or something to do with the spot shield marketing,0
whatever it be the smell lingers on other clothes stack on or near the shirt,0
that alone will keep me from buy another copy of this shirt,0
im and get the medium,0
fit be good overall,1
but the sleeve be too tight,2
not so tight as to ruin the shirt,2
but little annoying,0
so the medium be bit small on me overall,2
but im sure the large would be too large,0
as with most shirt,1
fabric be tiny bit on thin side,2
but not enough to be problem,0
i like the comfortably collar polo fabric well,1
but as of this date those be available in very few color,1
so glad get these for my son that be get the small because he yr old build like yr old,0
its hard find the perfect fit,1
but these be that perfect fit,1
they be long and the collar isnt to big like usual men shirt on kid,2
toatally awsome for those football defense build boy,0
the quality be pretty good for what you ’ re spending,1
i buy couple of these for job uniform,1
they wash and wear well,1
i think it may shrink after first wash,0
but not at all,2
what like most be they don ’ t really get dirty or wet,1
literally spill some of my lunch onnthe shirt when someone accidentally bump me and it didn ’ t leave stain on it when clean myself off,0
also get catch up work outside when it start pour rain and the shirt didn ’ t really even get soak and barely wet,0
rain drop bead up onnthe shirt,0
when get out of the rain pull the shirt off and shake it,0
and the bead up rain drop just fellflew off,0
will definitely buy few more soon so won ’ t have to wear any of my ‘ nice ’ polo to work anymore,1
i buy this one for my husband,1
the price be very cheap so we be hesitate about the quality,1
but we decide to try with black one he love it so much because be like wear tshirt,1
but with bit more style we be leave in texas the fabric be awesome for be comfortable in hot weather,1
so after the black one we buy charcoal one we confirm it be follow the same standard of the black one then we decide to buy more color and an extra black,0
now he be plenty of these polos he can wear them for go to office and for the weekend he can wear them with jean with docker or more formal pant and those fit with everything,0
ive buy halfdozen of these shirt in various color and love them,1
very comfortable and perfect for winter in arizona,1
daytime high in and,1
im and take sleeve in dress shirt and these shirt,0
xl size,0
be long enough in both the body and sleeve without need tall size,0
no shrinkage to speak of after multiple washing,0
two thumb up,0
my teen son who be on the autism spectrum be extremely picky about fabric so dont often buy clothe online for him,0
however he have to have slightly dressy shirt than his usual screen print tshirts for trip with his school and so order him few polo shirt from amazon,0
this particular shirt be so soft so comfortable that he texted me the first day he wear it in europe to thank me for buy the green collar shirt,1
thank you jerzees,1
some of the review with picture show tear in the fabric and claim it be very cheap,2
but my experience have not be as such,0
my job require us to wear polo to work and cover up tattoo so these longsleeve polo have be fantastic,0
i own the black navy and gray one and theyre comfortable despite be polyester which mind you be definitely not the most comfortable material,1
but this feel fine,1
i only ever use these for work,0
but if you want to go out and look little good than just casual tshirt these also look fantastic,1
ive buy polo where the wrist tend to be too loose,2
but this one hug around it very nicely and give it nice fit,1
so far so good definitely order more,1
i ’ m not very impressed with this shirt,2
but you get what you pay for,0
the quality be meh okay as back up when my good shirt be in the wash,1
thin enough that you can see my tattoo thru the sleeve so maybe use that in make decision,0
this be very nice look white polo shirt,1
the thickness be perfect,1
it be comfortable and thick enough so it be not seethrough,1
the stitching be well do and this shirt have hold up nicely in the wash,1
the collar do not curl in the wash which be really nice,1
it seem to be stain resistant,1
the fit be true to size,1
i purchase it for someone who be ft and it fit him perfectly,1
this be highquality shirt,0
i pay about,0
for this polo shirt from amazon,0
it be cotton polyester,0
overall the shirt fit as expect and be great value for the price,1
dont pretend you didnt know what you be get,0
of course cotton be more breathable,0
it also shrink,0
the blend do not and the shirt feel just fine,2
i work in warehouse where the men be expect to wear collared shirt,0
it be almost summer and it be get very hot,0
i want to get some polo shirt that be more of tshirt fabric,0
this polo be very thin and semi see through,2
but its exactly what need for its intend purpose,1
i didnt want to purchase your traditional polo that be usually thicker,0
this polo be definitely light and still look great,1
i dont have to wear an under shirt because since it be light and more of tshirt material it do not irritate my skin or make me itch,2
i recommend this polo if you want to still look semi business casual,1
i wash them with my other work clothing and dry them on delicate setting,0
low heat,2
it didnt shrink that much,0
but im not sure how much it will shrink if you dry on different dryer setting,0
goodlooking long sleeve white polo shirt,0
i buy this for someone who be hard to size,0
he be ft in and lift weight,1
this fit well in the chest and in the waist,1
usually if it fit the chest then the waist be big,0
but this be just right,1
it be be washed and it have hold its shape nicely and remain nice and white,1
the quality on the shirt be terrific and the thickness of the material be nice,1
i order of these for the summer,0
ive have them for about month,1
i wear each one about once week,0
theyre already show significant wear and pill everywhere,0
you do have to iron them,1
this be very disappointing especially because hang dry them,2
next summer ill definitely spend more money to buy high quality material that will last more than season,1
i doesnt shrink around the neck cause an uncomfortable restriction around the neck,0
the full coverage prevents sunburnespecially on the back of the neck,0
this shirt be make from thin material so its fine for cool weather,1
thicker fabric be sometimes be often too hot for fallspring,0
fit great,1
i also splash some food on it and it come off without be absorb,0
have not wash it yet so this feature may change over time,2
the price be low so my expectation be modest,1
i dont quite know why buy these shirt in cotton blend when what need be synthetic moisture wicking fabric,0
and sure enough it go to show cotton drag down fabric performance in summertime heat and humidity,0
but synthetic save the day,0
with fullon synthetic shirt sweat doesnt show and its drawn away to the outside where it can evaporate,0
almost any stain will disappear after few washing,0
and they dont fade,0
they last year and year even with daily use,0
these shirt approximate all that,0
but they be hotter on they will stain they do show sweat and they be heavy and more stifling than be use to,0
and the whole evaporative cooling effect that make me go aaaah,0
when the slight breeze come along just isnt there,2
these be more for light indoor work with only occasional outdoor exposure,0
this be good standard polo shirt,1
its good quality not too heavy great for summer,1
the price be good for what you get,1
i like my casual shirt on the loose side and this one do not run large at all,2
i would order jerzees again if need another polo shirt,0
i order this polo size medium for my husband who be and about pound,0
the pro,1
i love the deep forest green of this shirt and that it come in variety of color,1
my husband say that it be very comfortable and he wear in regularly,1
the con,0
this shirt do shrink bit,0
but that be to be expect from shirt that be cotton,1
the shirt seem to shrink length wise rather than width wise,0
the fabric feel cheap,2
it isnt soft,1
fit perfectly and be kinda skinny so its hard to find shirt that arent too big,1
but arent so small have to pull my shirt out of my armpit and pull my shirt below my tummy and my crack,2
teehee,0
i pretty much only buy this brand for myself anymore because they last at least few year since buy my first one almost year ago and wear single one of the several have at least once week,0
i will buy more,1
i have several of these shirt and they ’ re all great,1
really good “ uniform ” shirt,1
vibrant color,1
good comfortable fit,1
stain and spot resistance,2
but the kicker with this particular shirt be,0
i didn ’ t receive this shirt,0
what get be the long sleeve version in package label ‘ short sleeve ’,2
it ’ s good shirt and be consider get long sleeve or two anyway,0
i even double check my order just to be sure didn ’ t select the incorrect item,0
nope,0
just the wrong shirt in the right package,1
thing happen,0
happy accident,1
this product be defective,1
i purchase it for gift,1
the fabric be thin it arrive doubled bag,2
inside bag have previously be tear open,2
its defective,0
i an not reorder due to quality if fabric and appearance,2
surprisingly it be lot hard to find and expensive,0
this product be small fraction of what other company want and honestly be perfectly fine,1
it be durable enough to wear once month when he serve and doesnt look cheap,0
it be slightly big than what he expect,2
but not terribly big,2
we would recommend the shirt to anyone who be need of these specific,1
im not into logo on my clothes so really like these theyre very comfortable like tshirt with the collar,1
order the black it be different fit the first few be tagless this be not kinda disappointed dont think will be order anymore of these,2
seller be amazon picture mislead,0
try to get ahold of real person to send whats picture,0
impossible,0
great value for this shirt,1
i be order more in different color,1
make well,1
fabric be lightweight,1
but that be exactly what want for the warm nevada weather,1
the sizing be as state the size get be and it be just like most other from american company such as hanes duluth trade post etc,0
i always wash my clothes in cold water and dry on low heat so do not expect any shrinkage,2
the shirt arrive stuff in tiny box about x,1
when open the box note that the shirt appear to have be rebagged,0
the shirt fit fairly loosely,1
but look in the mirror could see my chest hair right through the shirt,0
it be make of very thin material and feel no thicker than lightweight undershirt,2
ive purchase good quality shirt from vendor for lt,1
previously on manhattan street corner,0
i should have return it,2
but wait too long,0
dont waste your money,2
its good when its new,1
but after few wash it look really old,1
wont buy again,1
ordered medium for my girlfriend as work shirt amp,0
she like her top biggerlooser,1
well shes amp,1
just under amp,0
the medium fit perfect,1
it fall just to her hip amp,0
wasnt too big,2
it be small for medium though should have order her large for good more comfortable fit,1
but these shirt do run bit small,2
nice quality decent shirt for the price,1
would buy again just know id size up if you be look to buy,1
shirt be great bargain for the price,1
it be not misrepresent in any way,2
it be thin shirt with polo style collar that be very comfortable to wear,1
if you want heavy traditional polo please look elsewhere,1
but for the money you will not be disappoint in this shirt,2
i order one to try then order four more,0
im busty female with really large arm,0
i have very difficult time find shirt that fit my chest and arm without be like moomoo in my stomach area,0
most woman shirt have super tight sleeve,2
these shirt be perfect,1
fit well through the chest and abdomen not tight not too loose,2
and the sleeve be perfect in length and width,1
they go to my elbow and dont slide up when move my arm,0
absolutely love these shirt and buy one in almost every color,1
i be look for inexpensive cotton polo shirt to wear in the winter primarily under other layer,0
the shirt would not need to be super fancy only comfortable,1
this shirt though very plain be exactly what be look for,1
it be also tagless which add to the comfort level,0
this shirt have nice long tail so it stay tuck in,1
i would not recommend this shirt for wear untucked,2
really happy with my new jerzees polo sport shirt,1
try both on and they both fit well and be just what want,1
cuff be snug which be good just right some shirt have very wide loose cuff which dont care for find loose cuff unattractive,0
get both shirt with long sleeve which want prefer these kind of shirt with long sleeve,0
quality shirt at decent price,1
you cant go wrong,0
i order m and it be true to size,0
but very very long,0
i will update once wash it to say whether it shrink at all,0
for the price id say its pretty decent shirt,1
not totally see through it be pretty comfy material and the collar isnt stiff and weird like some shirt,2
my husband need white polo,0
i order these because be pleased with the stainguard,1
once receive they felt little thin,2
i order more of different brand and try to return these,0
they say they be not eligible for return,2
i purchase them week ago so time be not the reason just they be not eligible for return,2
i would have never have purchase them if know they be final sale,0
i would recommend skip this sellerproduct altogether,0
bad business,2
great shirt for an even good price,1
they really be spot resistant and even water doesnt stain them,2
it collect as little droplet on the shirt look pretty cool and reduces dampness after rainspillsetc,0
color be vibrant fit be perfect for tuck in or leave untucked,1
i buy of them for use at work do relatively physical job and theyve hold up great and maintain their appearance,1
theyre breathable too which be an added bonus,0
highly recommended,1
i order these for my husband for work,1
he work in factory and he really like them,1
they be very comfortable dont wrinkle easily and dont show sweat,1
our only complaint be that they collect lint like crazy so if that matter to you buy lint roller to go with them,0
the shirt be good quality with great color that have be compliment on already in its first use today,1
the only issue be notice that if wash these shirt and purely hang dry as normally do the shirt run little big than normal for large,2
but its not to the point where its extra large size,2
so my tip be to wash and use dryer once then hand dry from that point on,0
this could be my mistake or my body,0
the shirt fit reasonably well except for that fact that it be very tight through the chest area,2
i may try medium versus the small size purchase,2
but suspect that would be little too big all around,2
the shirt appear to be good quality,1
i like the shirt and it be mostly comfortable,1
but dont have broad enough shoulder for the amount of space that they have for the top of the sleeve,0
this cause the sleeve to sag down until the end of the sleeve be at my elbow,0
i have to occasionally pull up the sleeve so they be at the right height,0
not as silky as underarmor,0
but very good for cotton blend,1
pretty soft,1
update buy two more one royal blue the other true red,0
the color be bright,1
but they have def change them,0
they be def thinner and not as soft,2
sleeve cuff be tight,2
its too bad they change,2
not as good,1
still not bad for the price,2
real cheap,2
however it drop them from star to star,0
these shirt be the equivalent of tshirts with collar,0
their cost and material be comparable,1
why wear classless tshirts when nice polo leave good first impression,1
the shirt lack any brand logo which be good for those who refuse to advertise over price brand,1
buy half dozen and you will be set for the summer,0
i order these shirt for my son,0
they be good quality and perfect for his it job,1
he be tall and they fit ok in length,0
but great around waist,1
they be not too thick so he can wear an undershirt and still stay cool,2
will be order more,0
very thin fabric,2
but it be inexpensive and come in the purple color that be the uniform color for the high school where my husband work as teacher,1
even though he can wear what he want most day because he be teacher not student he like to wear the school uniform fairly often,0
even when it be not spirit day,2
as positive role model for the kid who often seem to try to get away with wear something other then the required uniform,0
buy this for my year old son to wear for our family christmas photo shoot,0
it look great in the photo and fit him perfectly,1
almost everything we wear for our photo shoot be order last minute on amazon and arrive in time,0
to cheap,2
its like teeshirt only be polo,1
dont know where you would wear product like this,0
these be cheap and compare to polo you will notice the difference,2
the material be rough and they make you sweat alot,2
and work sit down all day,0
they do get the job do though,0
for reference im ’ and wear an xl which fit me just right not too big or small,2
evn though always toss them in the drier they don ’ t shrink which be another plus,0
the quality of this shirt supersede the price by far,1
i have large chest and back for my frame so usually need large,2
however the sleeve on large be usually bit long or loose,2
the medium fit little snug,2
but not enough to make me look like ive get something to prove,0
while this isnt the perfect shirt its great for wash and toss on,1
i buy it for my husband and after several wash ive noticed no fade pilling or shrinking,0
it doesnt wrinkle and he like to wear it to work as beat it up shirt,1
the collar be my only complaint,0
its soft and will curl if you dont watch it so if thats not an issue for you this be good purchase,0
you cant beat the price,1
i buy several of these shirt last year for my husband for christmas,0
he like them so much he ask for more this year for christmas,1
the shirt do not shrink when wash and dry,2
after wear and be wash and dry for year they look as they do when buy them,0

the fit be good not tight not too long,2
i be ’ ”,0
not skinny,2
but not huge,2
i order large,0
the sleeve be little long they come the full length of my upper arm and they should stop mid bicep or little long,2
the material be thin so decent warm weather shirt,2
also it be blend so it shouldn ’ t shrink,0
so for or so not bad buy and can get the sleeve tailor,2
i ’ m ’ and girl get this for job it ’ s little long,0
but it still look badass it ’ s not too long just few inch below the stomach like inch,2

supuestamente fue entregado la pm en pleno trabajo pero no fue así,0
no fue entregado,0
quiero saber que fue lo qué pasó donde fue que lo entregaron etc,0
necesito que lo envíen lo entreguen en la dirección que está especificada en el pedido nombre de la persona que se pidió que reintegren el dinero,0
después de tener una respuesta podré cambiar mi opinión,0
these shirt fit oerfect be have trouble find my son who be,0
but build like line backer school shirt and these save the day affordable right size and do not shrink when washed which be an important factor for us,0
one would expect polotype shirt of this quality to run at least if not more,2
how they pull this off for,0
ill never know,0
but suffice it to say be well pleased with this purchase and would highly recommend it to anyone in the market,1
these shirt run bit large,2
i order another one and size it down this time and be go to see how it fit,0
i havent wash this big size one yet,2
but still think even after wash its go to be bit large,2
i can wear it around the house when mow grass and such so its all good,0
they be thin and really cool during our hot summer weather,0
order this one becausevyhe last one ofvyhe same color develop an area of grey on my chest,0
for maroon shirt that be not good,1
have have several shirt from this company that have develop off color spot in past,0
the fabric wasnt quite what expect,1
it have the texture of mediumweight tshirt,0
despite that it still look good and fit the way think it would,2
if it prove to be durable and stainresistant then its an amazing deal,1
if not its still good deal,0
my husband be very particular about his clothes,0
he ’ s very happy with the weight feel of the fabric and the ease of launder,1
we only partially dry in the dryer then hang for the shirt to finish drying,0
we have order him several more in other color,1
what like best about this shirt be that it be make from great quality heavy material not that crap that get snag on anything that you walk by,1
very comfortable and great fit,1
i guess if you order the right size itll fit fine,1
right,1
great shirt,1
you look professionally dress wear these with casual pant whether youre at home answer the door get the mail newspaper etc,0
without look like one of the covid confine,1
for the price these be great shirt,1
buy them to use for work love the comfort there really soft,1
obviously not the polo brand,2
but for fraction of the price definetly good,1
i own already and plan on purchase more,1
want long sleeve polo shirt,0
fit the bill,1
warmth amp,0
comfort,1
i get this shirt for hubby for christmas since shopping in person be so dangerous and stressful right now,0
it be decent shirt,1
but not as soft as the polo from kohl,2
but hubby like it so its all good,1
im big fan of black polo,0
but im not fan of color fading,0
at this price if they fade can afford to buy new one every month,1
i prefer slim fit,0
broad back,0
but this be fine,1
i would also prefer short sleeve,2
these go down almost to my elbow,0
other than those minor gripe im pleased,1
love it,1
will purchase more for my boyfriend 🙂,1
this shirt be good value for the money,1
but they run small,2
my husband ordinarily wear large,0
but as luck would have it order him an xl and it fit him nicely,1
on the other hand the xl do not fit my son,0
who be tad large,0
i be go to return one of the xl,2
but the seller be only go to give me little over,0
for the shirt,1
instead be go to keep it and give it to someone who can use it,0
i love these shirt,1
they be bright dont shrink in the wash and fit perfectly after receive them,1
i be male tall and have waste so the xl size fit to tee,0
pun intend,0
i will most likely purchase more and recommend these shirt,1
i buy few different shirt like this for him to wear to work,1
they be size correctly,0
but the sleeve do seem long than they should be,0
these be great choice for him since he work in cigar shop and they stand up well to good washing to get that cigar smell out,1
first there be problem with the review process,0
there be the question how do this product fit,1
only one answer be accept so ill just say it here,0
this shirt be both too small,2
in some dimension,1
and too large,0
in other dimension,1
for example go up the sleeve it bind at the bottom and it hang way down your side at the top,2
love the color price and fit my husband just right,1
this polo be pretty good shirt the fit be pretty good and really like how it repel water the material be slightly thick than an average shirt so its not heavyweight shirt,1
but it have withstand several wash already so im pretty happy with it,1
it repel water and sweat well,1
havent test any oily stain though,0
it didnt shrink when wash it,0
and dry on low,0
preshrunk claim seem accurate,0
it fit well,1
it feel different from most shirt probably because of the hydrophobic coating,0
its comfortable enough though,1
i buy this polo because have jersey polo for several year that fit great,1
but be wear out,0
im glad to say that their sizing template be still very close to what it be year ago,0
buying clothes as tall slender person suck most clothes be make for short andor fat people,2
if you need long length shirt or sleeve you have to go up size which almost always mean they add several inch to the waist and then you end up with puffy shirt that drape and flap off you,0
this be the only brand of polo what ive find that fit good and have long length and tight fit,1
the fabric be pretty good,1
but could be bit soft,0
overall feel very comfortable wear this polo,1
love these shirt,1
theyre comfortable fit well and be affordable,1
you cant go wrong with these imo,0
love these shirt they be true to their size unlike other company that be size too small and short,1
the color be awesome they feel so comfortable and feel like they will last long time,1
they have not shrink when wash them just love them,1
so will you try them,0
excellent lightweight winter long sleeve shirt,1
they wash well fit perfectly and hold up well,1
and they come at great price,1
and theyre long enough,0
cant ask for more,0
star,0
unfortunately it hasn ’ t even be year and the shirt be fall apart,2
one shirt have hole in the back,2
the sleeve stitch on another shirt be come undone,2
the fabric on one shirt be wear out near the collar make my undershirt visible,0
its really comfortable after many use its great shirt to use for work related purpose,1
if you want to go out to special occasion would recommend more slim fit shirt than this one,1
this shirt be not slim fit,2
but its not too lose,2
i work at starbucks and this shirt do not inhibit your arm movement at all,0
highly recommend,1

it may be little thin,2
but nothing unusual,0

i tell him he will blend in with the water,0
i work at car rental business and we be in and out lot so its give that this thing be perfect for the winter,1
it will keep the water away surprisingly well,1
the main reason im fivestarring this be im skinny guy and the neck fit perfectly as well as the length of the sleeve,1
im,0
this shirt be an excellent winter shirt for the colder weather,1
highly recommend from jerzees,1
when you buy cheap product you can not expect the star,2
now these shirt dont feel cheap and fit fine will go one size small next time,2
i buy them for yard work and can not complain,0
yet would not wear them to paartay,0
pretty good overall for my kid school require outfit,1
but little on the thin side almost see thru and kid dont want to wear undershirt too,2
theyre wearable tho,0
these jerzes shirt be exactly as order,1
they be cotton blend knit,0
not that slick moisture wicking kind,0
they wash and dry very nicely plus they be very reasonable in price,1
this product look exactly like the picture,1
the color be deep and rich,1
it fit as expect,1
my year old son say it ’ s comfy,0
he wash his clothes and he ’ s not manage to shrink discolor or alter the texture,0
that be amazing,1
buy the large for my son who be lbs,0
it fit him well,1
arm length be excellent and not baggy in the torso,1
will have to see how it hold up after few wash,0
shirt fit fine,1
what like about the shirt be that not only be they wrinkle free,2
but it fit as expect,1
as always with the brand it be top notch material,0
however they arent stain resistant,2
nice shirt just lot thinner and light than expect,1
fit pretty much as expect,1
interested to see how it hold up over time,0
they fit as expect and wait on the be to see if they soften up,0
they be bit rough feeling,2
could just be me,1
but over all worth the price,1
thin material bit large than expect,2
but overall decent quality,1
sleeve be little long than other polo shirt purchase,2
but that may be because the whole shirt run bit large as mentioned,2
i order this shirt from the party seller,0
i be very careful to read review before buy,0
when the shirt arrive try it on,1
it be narrow than their size chart say it be,0
in addition the sleeve be as tight as woman panty hose,2
contact the seller about their defective merchandise,0
but they be no help,1
pay to ship it back lesson learn,0
buy this for my year old in size small navy,2
it will fit him just fine with some room to grow into,1
while not look sloppy,2
i take off star because this long sleeve be quite thin,2
i order long sleeve shirt for the winter month,0
something to consider if you be purchase these for cold climate,0
i wear xtra large im,0
it fit like it should,1
its good quality worth the money,1
it repel water,0
but it also keep body heat in,0
overall great buy,1
just what want,1
the fabric be very lightweight,1
but entirely opaque so it be great warm weather shirt,1
do not realize the band at the bottom of the sleeve would be slightly small than the sleeve themselves not really problem,2
but when put the shirt on need to pull the sleeve down,0
they seem to stay in place just fine afterwards,0
look and fit great,1
i buy this for my husband for christmas and it look great on him,1

however hang them to dry to prevent shrinkage,0
overall love these shirt have buy seven in total,1
buy this shirt for my son for school and their uniform call for either short sleeve or long sleeve white polo shirt,0
but because he grow we didnt want to spend too much money,0
but need to buy several so he have at least one for each day and on day where he have physed he have second,0
the shirt fit as expect and barely shrink when wash,1
we normally wash all white separately and dont use bleach,0
but something design for white clothes,0
the shirt may need iron,0
but its expected,0
we also replace his shirt every year because at what they cost its simply worth it,1
these be well make fit nicely and snug,1

need light and cool fabric in summer shirt,1
this polo be fantastic in both regard,1
i try the amazon essential brand polo and it be ok,0

a little too thick and warm for my taste,2
this jerzees polo feel more like t shirt,1
nice and light and comfortable,1
look awesome fit perfectly and what price,1
my husband need long sleeve polo for work and didnt think much of it when he purchase this,0
but they actually look great,1

the fit be spot on perfect,1
the quality be great,1
washesdries well so far no color fade,1
my son stay they be very comfortable and soft,1
this be great value for this type of shirt,1
the fabric be bit light weight than some of the big name brand,2
but that be really no big deal,0
i will probably order few more in some of the other color available,0
for the price be very happy with the color fabric and feel of this shirt,1
go to grab me some more next month,0
i use them to work in every day have to wear polo shirt to work everyday and theyre very comfortable and warm and great fit,1
i order color of these in an xl and much to my surprise they fit like an xl at least for me they do,1
as far as comfort go they be not like wear super soft shirt,0
but its not deal breaker either,0
i use them when need something touch well than t shirt would order them again,1
very nice product what like the best be the warmth provide during the winter month,1
order two of these different color,0
shirt be nice and soft and fit well,1
probably bit thin compare to most polo shirt,2
but for consider it bargain,1
good fit good material nice look shirt can wear to work,1
just as good as the shirt if not well,1
i spill drink on my shirt and when pull the cloth straight the liquid fly off leave only micro dot and these do not stain,2
cool,1
i order three shirt light blue short sleeve burgundy short sleeve and green short sleeve,2
the green one come as long sleeve,2
be little surprised because my order always come through correctly,2
i be go to return the green one for my son,2
but he say no problem the shirt fit fine,1
that be what these feel like,1
i have several of them now in various color,1
great shirt,1
very happy even after at least dozen wash,1
color stay bright after repeat washing,1
however the black one tend to slightly fade to more of dark charecoal color after about washing,0
perhaps the others be fade too,0
but you do not notice it as much as the black,2
i think this be polo shirt they turn out to be long sleeved shirt not what expect of wanted,2
i need them for cold weather condition it be degree today how can go outside wear one of these shirt,0
good quality polo,1
buy small than usual size though,2
even after wash several time its shrinkage be minimal,2
a fit like,1
other than that its great shirt,1
highly recommended,1
expect color to be dark brown as show,1
but come tan,2
all the other shirt color be exact ad show,0
great shirt comfy and soft,1
you cant beat the price and the overall fit and appearance,1
while the length of the shirt be great for tuck in,1
short or pant,2
if not tuck in the bottom fourth easily show wrinkle once you sit down,2
not huge deal,2
but its worth knowing if you typically dont tuck in polo style shirt,0
i purchase eighteen of these on leap of faith and can not be more pleased,0
these be about third of the cost of the brand have be use and,0
while my previous brand be marginally well for the price these be five star value in my opinion,1
these be fairly thin about the same weight as medium weight tshirt,0
but be nicely make with excellent stitching and fit that be as good as the more expensive polo shirt that they be replace,1
if there be single complaint the collar do not lay as nicely as my premium shirt,2
but that be minor consider the price,1
i test fit them when first receive them and after be satisfied that would not be return them machine wash them on coldcold and there be no shrinkage that could discern,2
more importantly there be no fading,1
i will say that when dry them the lint trap do fill quickly so on first wash there be lot of loose fiber,0
bottom line these be decent quality and especially for the price,1
they be almost as well make and fitting sa premium brand polo shirt and if you be on budget be definite bargain,1
it come quickly as promise and fit well,1
the color be exactly what be look for,1
the material wasnt too heavy nor too thin,2
the shirt fit right feel great and the collar go not curl,1
great shirt for the price,1
i need decent shirt to embroider my radio station logo on it and this shirt be perfect,1
it fit perfectly and be comfortable for the live activity we do on regular basis,1
excellent purchase,1
i will purchase more,1
just the kind of material be look for,1
i be very pleased,1
no visible shrinkage after first wash and no color bleed,0
size run very small,2
ordered feel like,1

after the ride be dry in minute,0
look good fit well and only,1
i will buy more,1
the polo shirt be purchase to wear,0
while work around the house,0
but it could be an everyday item,1
it be too large until it be wash and now it be tight,2
definitely decent shirt at low price,1
the fabric need to be stretch to make them less long and big amount for us full body guy,2
this polo shirt be slim fit for people with some extra pound be to tight we suggest to try next size one shirt first then buy more if you like the quality which be fair for the price,1
this shirt look nice on me,1
a little long to keep on top,2
but figure way around that,2
ive be cautious and keep it away from the dryer because it would certainly shrink,0
no issue with it,0
but it be thin,0
i buy few for my ten son for work now that ’ s cooler,0
he have to wear tshirt under it though because it ’ s much thin than his other work shirt,0
it do shrink bite so that ’ s why buy an extra large,0
it ’ s somewhat wrinkle free,2
read the size chart to make sure it be the fit you want,0
my husband be tall and thin so the large fit him just right,0
but it might fit stocky guy bit tight,2
the material use be not very thick so it wont keep you warm on cold day,2
we be disappoint by how thin it be,2
but overall it be ok for the price,1
it feel lot of synthetic material use in it it do not feel light and not breathe material,2
cheaply pack and cheap look to the whole thing the sleeve end with very tight end very unhappy,2
good quality for the price this shirt and its green twin be hold shape and color,1
stain resistant treatment realy work,0
the slevees be bit long than my other polo style shirt,2
but not crazy long,2
no wrinkle if you hang it,0
while still warm from the dryer,0
this be great shirt for big and tall guy,1
it wash so good and stay soft,1
plus it didn ’ t shrink at all in the dryer,0
my hubby love them,1

but they don ’ t fade or shrink,0
and there ’ s lil play room not all snug on him,2
i ’ m very satisfied with the quality,1
i love these jerzees because they fit great and they look even well,1

just an average polo,0
it be hard to find nice polo shirt with wide range of size,1
,1
this be ok,1
but not awesome for the large size and my frame,2

true to size,1
have yet to wash it to see how it will hold up,0
but the material suggest it will be just fine,1
great price,1
like the blend and the xlarge work great for,1
not sure how it will come out of the wash,2

i like it good than some perry ellis long sleeve buy,1
the cuff be too small and have to cut them off,2
youre well off buy the nicer polo work shirt,1
i be very happy with the high price purchase,1
the material isnt very breathable,2
it be overall waste of money,1
but do its job until the high quality shirt come,1

not worth spend more than for this product get good quality from other band at less price,1

super baggy order size down,0

i purchase this shirt in deep purple for my work uniform,1
it fit true to size,1
but little long which dont mind,2
its not heavy cotton which be nice for the summer month,1
the only reason didnt give star be because the sleeve be really long,2
i think its unisex shirt,0
if im wrong and its men shirt then the sleeve length be appropriate,0
which be why get it,0
however when try it on and subsequently wear it have to roll the sleeve up little,0
they reach my elbow,0
ok shirt,1
but kind of thin material,2
i prefer it be little heavy shirt,2
but do have somewhat cheap feel to it,2

its thinner material,0
but that work good for me i dress in light layer,1
good buy for the price and quality of the product,1
i like the first one buy buy three more,1
good buy on very stylish and comfortable shirt,1
fit odd,1
i can deal with it since it doesn ’ t look too weird as result and it ’ s just for work,0
but wish would have know since bought of them,0
order large fit like an xl or xxl,0
i would definitely recommend to at least order one size down,1
other complaint be the shirt be bit too long too,2
other than size issue product look well make and on the thicker side,1
have to return,2
my fiance love it and it look incredible on him as he doesnt like tight sleeve,1
but the material be rather fragile,2
need some new polo shirt stat and these be perfect,1

thanks lot,1
the size fit right around the shoulder and neck,0
but the arm feel little long,2
the material be also not that breathable so it get kind of stuffy underneath,2
great fit good quality,1
i need this color and style for work,1
they be perfect and cheap enough,1
i be female,0
but they be men ’ s buy the xl and the fit good for my size which would be xl woman ’ s,0
i have several of these shirt in different color,1

i use as my uniform as cashier,0
great value,1
very durable,1
my son luvs it,0
fit be excellent would purchase again,1
shrink after wash despite what they might say,0
perfect fit,1
perfect for cooler weather,1
poor quality of material,2
disappointed,2
nice shirt just dont dryer it,1
shrink something awful,0
other then that fit like it be suppose to and good size,1
after decade of deal with rl shirt that dont last and cost more,0
not an exaggeration,0
find these to be good fit and value,1
i start buy these in long sleeve and get one in short sleeve by accident when change to sandstone and the picture show long sleeve white,2
be prime order figure if it wasnt right when it arrive would ship it back,0
well color be nice,1
but it come as short sleeve,2
a happy accident because would never have start order these if hadnt discover how much good these be than my polo,1
i order medium,0
the order choice show sml and on and on,0
then they say adult adult adult etc,0
since they dont say child sm,0
i take chance on the low price that come with the exclusion of the word adult,0
ill have to assume adult label must be euphemism for bamp,0
t or something else associate with extra roomy because im not child size,0
im currently,0
the waste be loose enough to hide less than flat ab,2
the shoulder fit without hang over and dont look sloppy yet still have lot of room in the chest and body,0
length be great for low cut jean,1
but too much if not tuck in,2
much more suited to be tuck in to deal with below waste jean issue,0
i actually find myself return for small which be really strange sizing,2
i give very little thought to the claim of spot protection until watch salsa disappear with just wet sponge,0
so far they be hold up through wash,1
but caution anyone who do not thoroghly understand how laundry machine work,2
you can not use high heat and the tough cycle for every type of garment,0
unless you be wear these on construction job and let it sit for week before wash you should use gentle wash cycle and low heat dry with finish guard sensor dryer,0
if you dont have access to proper dryer or time to watch over timed laundromat machine remove,0
while slightly damp and use hanger for final drying,0
everything will last long with more care regardless,0

i be go to order few more for my husband,0
i need the polo tshirt my work and it come right on time and it fit perfectlyi buy the medium size and it fit me really goodi would recommend somebody to this seller,1
,1
the male in residence wear large polo shirt and the large size fit perfectly,0
what distinguish the shirt from regular model be the fabric be treat with spot shield which help repel water and other substance that may stain,2
like all treat fabric to preserve the life of the treatment laundering require avoid chemical and high heat,0
specifically mention on the fabric care instruction,2
locate on part of the tagless label print inside the shirt below the collar,0
be to not use fabric softener,2
the fabric care symbol be hard to read which be why be note them herethe shirt should be machine wash cold tumble dry on low no iron no bleach and no dry cleaning,0
i measure the large shirt both before and after launder to gauge shrinkage which be minimal,2
chest circumference at point under each arm around be inch before wash inch after,0
length of the body from the top of the shoulder to the hem be inch before launder inch after,0
sleeve length be inch from top of shoulder to cuff both before and after wash,0
the circumference of the sleeve opening be inch before laundering and ½ inch after,0
promptly remove the shirt after dry eliminate all wrinkle,2
the bottom of the shirt have inch hem which seem sufficient to prevent rolling and the body of the shirt itself be form like tube and have no seam,0
since seam can rub and chafe eliminate any of them increase comfort,0
there be loose thread in the bottom hem stitch which suspect will be problem if leave as be so will need to tack that down to ensure it do not unravel,2
this may be an anomaly with the shirt receive otherwise construction be good,1
economical basic polo shirt treat to be stain resistant in wide offering of color and size,0
this shirt be for the garbage send it back to china or take it off the web rather give my dollar to homeless person then this shirtthe material be make from crud oil garbage and have pcb in it,0
dont bother to buy this shirt,0
very nice shirt for the price,1
i be amaze at how comfortable they be and the fit be excellent even after wash,1
material be light weight so they be more geared for warmer weather,0
the tail be long enough to be wear untucked,0
i dont particularly like my shirt snug so order up size and im glad that do,0
the only down side to this shirt be that there be no shirt pocket,2
overall id say that youd be press to find good shirt at the price these be offer for,1
this shirt be style basically like tshirt with collar,1
it seem like the quality of shirt you would expect for uniform in fast food restaurant or auto repair shop where youre deal with mess and spillsnot shirt you would wear to the office or nice look to wear around casually,1
it be pretty cool to watch how it shed liquid and that should extend the life of keep deep stain out if launder properly,0
i be not fan of how it look and neither be my wife,2
i bring green uniform with collar on it and it work great for work,1
but it be too big,0
but its okay,1
it will shrink later on,0
i have try to wash the green shirt with collar and the color do not fade off,2
seven buck for t shirt be great deal,1
while walmart and retail store doesnt carry green shirt with collar on it,0
if you weigh pound tall skinny small be right for you,2
cause when you get medium shirt get have m m on it,0
it would be too big for you and the sleeve be very long to your elbow,2
with this price cant complain,1
i have have the shirt for three month,1
i want an inexpensive casual lounging shirt,0
it fit that need do not wrinkle,2
even when leave in the dryer for two day,2
the blend though make it somewhat clammy if you get active and sweat,0
not as absorbent as highercotton blend,2
bottom line get what want for decent price,1
update,0
,1
have raise my rating to,0
from,1
i get similar shirt,0
from different manufacturer,1
but same price range,1
with blend,0
it be more comfortable blend for activewear,1
this shirt,1
however fit well,1
i can tell it be not go to last as long as more expensive shirt,0
but be fine with that,1
i be the kind of person who would rather have new cheap shirt every four or five month and then just pitch it rather than spend more and get expensive shirt that last long,0
but then end up have closet full of old shirt never wear,0
cheap decent quality logoless shirt be my thing and so give it five star because that be exactly what expect and exactly what get,1
if you like long lasting highquality clothing then would suggest look for something else and spend much more,0
however if you be like me then go for this one,1
unless they raise the price over buck then go for something else ha ha,0
i like the shirt,1
for the price it ’ s perfect,1
this jerzees mens spot shield short sleeve polo sport shirt look good and fit well,1
the shirt be perfect for casual event,1
the material be good quality and have hold up nicely with normal wear,1
highly recommended,1
cfh,0
this be very nice basic polo shirt,1
it be lightweight and fit truetosize,1
i wash it in warm water and dry it on low,0
it keep its shape and didnt show any appreciable shrinkage,0
it be wrinklefree if it be remove from the dryer immediately,0
this be good work shirt or project day at home shirt,1
its not what would call fashion wear,2
but great for at home or quick run to the store similar to tshirt only stain resistant,1
this shirt by jerzees fit exactly as expect for the size,1
the fit be slightly loose and its comfortable,1
the band around the sleeve be not tight and the collar isnt scratchy,2
the seam be sewn evenly and seem strong,0
the fabric isnt too thin or thick,2
but its also not as soft as wed like,2
its not exactly rough or scratchy,2
but would probably feel comfy if wear over an undershirt,0
the color be bright and vivid,1
the spot shield work well to repel drip and drop so it stay look clean longer,1
overall its very nice shirt,1
it could be soft,1
but its still comfortable,1
this shirt live up to its name,0
as someone who always pressure anymore and worry about stain prior to work,0
this shirt have not,2
it dry and so far no stain have be create from perspiration,0
it ’ s also lighter in weight than most shirt of this style which love about it as well,1
the color have hold up in the wash,1
slight shrinkage after the first wash,0
but that ’ s to be expect,1
i will purchase again,1
this do repel liquid and stain to good extent,1
im not sure if it be coat with something or if it be from the slightly tight weave,2
water for instance just bounce off unless it be very large amount,0
this effect have last through an initial wash and wear,0
the tradeoff suppose be that the fabric be not as soft as some other brand,2
its acceptable though,0
it isnt itchy or rough,0
it do fit true to size and the styling be typical,1
there be no real surprise in the sizing cut or color,1
it be very typical polo shirt in bright royal blue,0
the sizing for the xl,0
only the xl,0
be,1
chest inch measure at underarm to underarm and double,0
total length top of fold down collar to bottom of hem inch,0
sleeve width at edge,0
inch,0
this be great shirt,1
nothing fancy and be exactly what be hop for,1
it fit nicely feels nice and go well with my darker pair of blue jean,1
ive worn it several time and it hasnt seem to really shrink in the wash,0
another plus,1
if youre in the market for good quality polo without any frill this be safe bet,1
basic long sleeve polo,0
decent quality for the price,1
fit loose,2
it do small bad out of plastic bag it definitely need to be wash before wear,2
this be comfortable basic polo,1
i like the material,1
but not as much as the mercurized cotton feel of ralph lauren polos,2
my wife say it look cheap like high school club polo,2
but think thats overly harsh,0
its comfortable basic polo that fit well around the shoulder and look durable,1
recommend,1
perfect for me though the material its thin,1
but as price for this its okay,1
well it look nice on me,1
so yeah,1
i approve,0
the medium size be big than me cause usually in tshirts im size medium so,0
i return it and get the size small,2
i get this for my husband and it be way too big for him,2
he be ’,0
” with size chest and size ” waist,0
and this large shirt be big on him,2
i ’ d qualify it as classic xl fit,0
color be dull,1
but for ten buck this be good buy,1
just make sure you get one size small than usual,2
star,0
if you be look for fit polo shirt you should look elsewhere,1
this shirt be way too big for its size and the overall style be target office clerk,2
i dont think its worth your money,0
fit great,1
work perfect,1

i rate this star for its good value for the buck,1
it be combination of cotton and polyester and so it be practically no ironing need,0
the material be thick and sturdy,1
it just look like any regular polo shirt nothing fancy or special,2
on the negative side it doesnt feel very soft and somewhat scratchy,2
the fabric on this be awful very uncomfortable very very cheap,2
not too shabby for the price,0
four star because hubby hasnt wear it much and it hasnt go thru wash cycle yet and think this style of polo kind of make hubby touch old look,1

my teenager be grow so tall,0
he be out of his shirt he have long torso,0
adult small it be,2
the length of the shirt be long,0
but it doesn ’ t look bad,2
fit perfect,1
this be great shirt,1
it fit well and be ship quickly,1
fit right well made great price,1
good,1
nice,1
just how like wear my shirt,1
esta franela no me llegó no sé cómo hacer que me hagan el reembolso puse que lo devolvía pero e que no me ha llegado al parecer di entender que lo tuve alguna vez no e así,0
good fit material and stitching be nice,1
i like the fit,1
no shrinkage so far,0
good work shirt,1
color fit feel,1
this polo be literally see through and do not fit at all,2
do not get this polo,2
i will buy it again,1
the color be perfect go with many piece in my wardrobe and fit like dream,1
wash and dry perfectly,1
ill be able to layer it for the winter too,1
it come on time look great and be well worth the price,1
back in the day of wear suit to work it be always easy to get the correct size for an office shirt,1
these be give by collar size,0
apparently get that correct and somehow the chest and backlength be correct too,0
but for casual wear these be only give by rough chest size,0
for me that would be size m,0
however be tall and slim and mean it be too short for length,0
and the collar size be still totally hit and miss,2
a loose collar be no good here in the uk,1
i solve the length problem by buy cheap tshirt of the same size cut off about inch of the bottom and attach it to the first shirt with hemtape,2
anyway the msize of this shirt be just right for me,1
long enough in the back – no hem tap here just about ok collar size,0
perhaps tiny bit loose,2
but acceptable,0
the shirt also have good close fit around the wrist and be soft and comfortable to wear,1
i guess you cant expect much more consider the price,1
pay the price of gap polo shirt youre gon na get the material and thats kinda what it feel like,1
but it you be lookgin for light summer tshirt with collar and dont want to care about accidently ruin an expensive shirt this be recommend go to,1
i think these jerzees will become my aroundthehousedad shirt,0
son de buena calidad llegó justo cuando se dijo que llegaría,0
si buscas una camisa polo ajustada esta no e tu opción e un poquito más larga que las comunes pero realmente luce muy bien,0
when these arrive,1
arrive really fast,1
be little concerned that they be cheap shirt,2
price be cheap,0
but not necessarily the quality of the shirt itself,2
the shirt appear to be little thin when remove it from its bag,2
but the shirt when worn be not really that thin in actuality,2
the thin appearance when hold it up be just that in my opinion an appearance,2
what it do do be let the shirt breath extremely well allow you to remain cool than expect on warm day,1
while at the same time keep you warm on cooler day,1
buy two of these one in green and one in black and be really happy with my purchase,1
curious to see how the color hold up after few wash,0
évidemment à ce prix la qualité nest pa supérieure mais jadore ce polos,0
jen ai identiques de couleurs différentes parce quils ne sont pa chers,0
je les recommande fortement à tous ceux qui aiment ça être vêtus décontractés,0
pour quelquun qui pèse livres comme moi il faut un xl,0
i order medium,0
but when try it on it fit too large,0
shirt hang down well below my waist and the sleeve go down to my elbow,0
it ’ s nice enough shirt nice color look sharp,1
just fit too large so return it,2
prospective buyer might want to consider order size small,2
el único inconveniente e que la talla está muy grande mi parecer parece más como talla xl,0
de lo demás todo bien,0
im on the edge of small and medium size so depend of the shirt polo tshirt would say that medium be usually my best fit,0
but sometimes small be ok,2
so after read some of the review be concern by the medium size be too large for me,0
i dont like to wear too tight clothes,2
so ordered medium size and for me this polo shirt be just perfect give me enough room to be comfortable without look too large,1
the fabric be nice soft and confortable,1
but not very thick,2
this for me be perfect because thick fabric polo shirt be not as confortable,1
also thick fabric tend to be warm which dont need for summer polo,2
finally the color be perfect and the price just great,1
these shirt be really comfortable and the darker colour look quite sharp,1
theyre basically high quality long sleeve tshirts with collar,0
they wash well with little wrinkle,2
but dont dry them too long in the dryer,0
im big guy who be somewhere between xl and,0
the fit me perfectly so if youre not too sure get the large size,0
im buying more,0
wish they have dark charcoal grey,0
all good except material feel bite too synthetic need more cotton,1
may soften up with couple washing,0
then again it may last long than cotton,0
muy bonita se ajusta perfecto el color e como el que se muestra en la fotografia no duden en comprar,0
we order an xl and it be true to size,0
the fabric be thin and light,2
sadly,0
it say it ’ s cottonpoly preshrunk fabric,0
but it shrink couple inch at the bottom only,0
it go into warm dryer not hot,0
but it ’ s it ’ s preshrunk that shouldn ’ t matter,0
we didn ’ t need crop top,0
amazon be gracious and do return,2
la calidad no e suprema pero e bastante decente es sport cómo se puede observar el color e tal cual se muestra en las imágenes de la publicidad,0
consejo revisen bien la tallas en internet cotejen con la suya posteriormente vengan elegir el producto de su conveniencia para evitar errores en su pedido,0
i order medium size,0
but what receive be triple m,0
large than medium size,0
i like the quality,1
but want actual size,0
i need to order large quantity in different size,0
but dont want them triple size,0
no mmm no ss or lll or xl,0
i would recommend these shirtsthe same in men clothe store be more money,1
only thing dont understand be why the black and blue in these same shirt be more expensive,0
if they where the same price as this one purchase would for sure have purchase both the other colour,1
other reviewer describe this as lightweight oversized shirt and that be precisely the reason buy it,0
this polo shirt hold its colour and shape when it be wash,1
i would recommend to people look for something comfy to wear with legging or pajama pant,0
no recomendable para áreas calurosas aun cuando es delgada la tela no se siente la misma sensación que con una camisa de algodón,0
la talla queda perfecto el color e exacto al de la descripción pero la calidad de la tela es muy mala muy delgada no la recomiendo,0
it fit okay,1
i will see after wash it because its itchy with the starch in the fabric,0
the cuff be little tight around the wrist,2
i be advertise that it be tagless in the product review,0
but it wasnt,0
i have to cut the tag off,0
pain,0
excelentes playeras yo las compré para el uniforme del trabajo la uso diaria se han despintado lo normal debido al uso pero muy poco tela fresca cómoda además de ligeras pero de buena calidad,0
la compré como regalo para un hombre de,0
mt kg compré talla mediana le quedó muy bien,0
el corte es recto no es fit ni nada de eso así que se ve un poco informal,0
el color tal cual como en la descripción,0
recibí el producto correcto talla correcta color correcto,0
muy feliz yo la persona del regalo,0
la calidad del algodón deja mucho que desear,0
obvio e una camisa muy económica así que obtienes lo que pagas,0
sinceramente mejor pagar un poco más por algo de mejor calidad,0
for such an inexpensive shirt this more than meet my expectation,1
the cotton poly blend be great because it doesnt shrink in the dryer to the ridiculous extent that cotton do,0
nice quality and well make,1
ill be buy for my grow son,1
un buen producto relación precio calidad buena,0
recomendable,0
la descripción del producto no especifica el corte no es corte regular e slim fit,0
la tela e muy delgada e casi transparente muy pobre calidad pero por el precio no se puede esperar más,0
parece ropa desechable no la recomiendo,0
la playera polo está bien viene un poco grande regularmente soy xl pedi y me quedo muy bien recomiendo que si van pedir pidan una talla más chica la acostumbrada la tela está delgada muy agradable para ambientes cálidos recomendado,0
fit be okay roomy enough except for wrist where it be too tight,0
can understand why reviewer have complain shirt rip at wrist,2
material be rather thin,2
shirt be cotton and polyester not really soft,2
overall impression be shirt be cheaply make to achieve low selling price,1
good option out there,1
the color and the fit be great,1
but the fabric be very thin,2
maybe ok for the hot summer day,0
but not for the other season,0
i dont think it will last very long,0
but the price be good so it be your call,1
this be just shirt for work and it fit feel and look just fine,1
will probably buy another,1
i order of the white polo shirt and there be no way to return the item back,2
the quality of the shirt be very poor with it be see through and the size be too large for what be advertised,2
ive try to contact amazon customer service as well as the seller,1
but they all say that the item be not eligible for return,2
im not sure what to do with these shirt now which make it complete waste of money,2
extremely disappointed,2
