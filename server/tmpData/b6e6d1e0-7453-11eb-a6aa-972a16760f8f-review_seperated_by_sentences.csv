we purchased 3 of these shirts for my son,
"all the same brand, all the same size, all from amazon,",
but i did a review on each color because they do differ,
"i don’t know if everyone is like me or not,",
but i heavily rely on product reviews when placing online orders,
purchase #1 of 3 white,
runs really big,
my son started a new job at one of the chain hardware stores,
they require that he wear a collared shirt,
"he didn’t have any and being that he works in the garden center, i knew they would get dirty and didn’t want to spend a lot",
we ordered 3 of these shirts from the same brand,
this particular one is white,
i am not very happy with this one,
the material is super thin and it is scratchy,
"you can almost see through it,",
but it works ok because he wears a vest over the shirt at work,
"i will say on a positive note though, the shirt has gotten pretty dirty and has cleaned up well",
for $9,
"00, i probably wouldn’t buy again, i will wait for a sale at one of the department stores and get a better, softer quality shirt",
_________________________________,
purchase #2 of 3 ash grey,
runs pretty true to size,
"as mentioned in my other shirt review, my son is required to wear a collared shirt at work",
"being that he works in a hardware store, we knew they would get dirty and didn’t want to spend a lot",
we ordered 3 of these shirts from the same brand,
this particular one is grey,
"out of the 3 we purchased, this one is far the best",
it is made of thicker material than the white one,
it is way softer than the white one and it fits more true to size than the white one,
it has always amazed me how you can buy multiple items from the same seller and they fit differently,
he wears this one the most,
"even on days when he gets it super dirty, it washes up easily without even using prewash/stain remover",
i am happy with this one considering the price we paid,
_________________________________,
purchase #3 of 3 charcoal,
runs a bit big,
this review is for the charcoal colored shirt,
"the shirt is a nice dark color,  which helps keep it clean",
i was concerned about the shirt being too hot,
"as mentioned in my other shirt reviews, my son works at a hardware store in the garden center and is outside a lot",
"the shirt is lightweight and thin, so he hasn’t gotten too warm in it",
"being that the color is dark, the fact that it is thin is not a big issue like it is with the white one",
"much like the white shirt, the material on this one is a bit scratchy",
it’s been washed several times and still has that scratchy feeling,
"also much like the white one, this one tends to run a bit larger than a regular xl shirt",
we have been rotating the 3 shirts during his weekly schedule,
"although they may not be my favorite purchase or even really a great “deal”, i wouldn’t return them",
"all 3 shirts, despite their differences, have held up well and are good work shirts",
"this time of year you don't need a sweater in mississippi yet,",
but long sleeves are a must,
i was looking online for some cost-effective long-sleeve shirts that i could easily wear for business casual and casual,
this was perfect,
it looks good with slacks or jeans,
looks and feels good,
"the fabric is a little light compared to the ""heavy cotton"" that is often used in such shirts,",
but it is good,
"when they say they will deliver a 4x xl,  they mean business",
i am a big guy and need the big sizes,
but this shirt has that covered,
these are awesome,
first and foremost it is a jersey knit not a polo knit: so it feels like a light weight tee shirt which is awesome in the summer time,
i work a combination of indoors and outdoors so a tee shirt with a collar is a real plus around my office,
the fit is amazing,
i'm built like a fire plug,
"5'11"" and 220 lbs",
"i have a 48"" chest,",
but normally wear a 50-52 coat for my shoulders,
"well, the xl is a perfect fit for me",
a large fits me better across the chest  and is more form fitting,
"it's snug,",
but not tight,
but the xl fits my shoulders and is a lot more comfortable,
in my opinion the sizing is spot on accurate,
"from the jerzees website: l = 46, xl = 50",
even better than the way it fits in the chest is the sleeves,
they go all the way to my elbows,
a standard polo sleve bunches up and creeps up to my shoulder,
this shirt has a roomy shoulder so it doesn't bunch up and the sleeves go all the way to my elbow,
straight armed it stops about 1,
"5 - 2"" above the crease in my inner elbow",
lastly is the length,
at 5'11 i can tuck this shirt in into my jeans or slacks and it looks great,
most polo shirts in an xl are either way too long,
hang past my crotch,
or way too short,
stop at my belt,
this one was designed to be worn tucked in,
"if you are taller than 6 feet, i'd look at the tall sizes",
if you're heavier,
thicker in the middle,
look at the numbered sizes,
"a ""secret"" to shirt sizing that many don't know is that an xxl and a 2xl are not the same cut",
in football terms an xxl is for a running back,
while a 2xl is for a lineman,
if you're stocky in the middle get the numbered size,
if you're a big guy with a v-back,
narrow waist,
", then go for the multiple x sizing",
for washing,
the tag says machine wash and machine dry,
personally: i just toss them in the machine on cold and then dry them on low to about half way,
15-20 minutes on low heat,
then hang dry them the rest of the way so they don't shrink,
they're not supposed to shrink since they're 50% poly,
but it is still a knit shirt,
needed a green shirt for work,
i’m 5’0 weighing at 200lbs so i did order a medium being that men clothing run bigger than women,
i wore a thin v neck shirt under so it did fit snug like a medium should,
i thought the shirt was great,
it fit me perfect,
i am a regular medium,
5’7” 156 lbs,
"the length was right for my height , i got the navy blue and looks great with jeans or chinos",
i did not see anything cheap about it and i like their hoodies too,
i bought these as a cheap replacement for my old all cotton shirts by another company altogether,
they do seem cheap,
"firstly, they have a strong chemical odor not usually associated with cotton/polyester",
at least not in my experience,
"secondly, they are very thin",
the material is light in weight,
they may do be5tter after a washing,
i got them not 30 minutes ago,
", and we will have to see",
the one thing that i am afraid of is the material may be actually more polyester than cotton,
"it is ""supposed"" to be 50/50",
"but, i really don't think so",
"i am relying on my experience in clothing, and my first visual impression to make that statement",
i am not expecting much,
will update in a few months,
if they last that long,
"24 hrs later: washed etc, they did ""fluff"" a miniscule amount",
i noticed that when i took them from the washer they were almost dry to the touch which leads me to believe less cotton,
more polyester,
like that the collar does not get a permanent crease,
armholes are good size for men with muscles,
"my husband usually complains they are too tight,",
but he likes these,
"length is perfect  for average 5'7"" man",
husband said that the stistitching on the bottom edge is very nice,
"has been washed multiple times, color is still intact",
material doesnt pick,
"shirt is used for work, manual labor, getting dirty etc",
not a desk job,
but looks nice too- so it would still be nice for office,
dry's fairly quickly when he gets wet,
"not a bad wrinkle shirt, very good wash and wear, is 50/50 poly/cotton",
will be orderung a good deal more of these,
were hesitant at first when it arrived,
the shirt was never worn &amp,
it's already ripping at a seam,
we washed it per the washing instructions &amp,
"the first time it was put on, we noticed the rip",
poor quality and not well made,
"it fit great, i guess you get what you pay for",
"if you have a dog that sheds, please be forewarned that this shirt will collect every single dog hair in the dryer",
every,
single,
one,
#polyester it will come out looking like your animal is attached to it somehow,
i have to spend ten minutes,
not exaggerating,
removing dog hair with both a lint brush and a lint sticky roller,
"the shirt is great and fits great and washes well with no fading and wrinkling,",
but it is not pet hair friendly,
"everyone else, knock yourself out, because it is a great shirt",
won't be ordering any more of these,
any food that gets on them leaves a stain that never comes out,
i've never had shirts stain so easily,
"if you spill a drink on it, it beads up and rolls off, which is cool",
"but any kind of sauce, oil, anything with fat will instantly and permanently bond to the shirt",
on the plus side they fit great and look nice,
fabric is thin and cool,
i wear them every day as work shirts,
but i can't be replacing them constantly because i get a little dribble of salad dressing on them,
these are essentially long sleeve t shirts with collars,
the material is extremely thin,
"i expected them to be thicker, similar to some jerzees t shirts i have",
"however, the fit is excellent on me so i kept them",
don’t count on them keeping you very warm though,
"if it’s ultralight weight you’re looking for , these are perfect",
they should breathe well,
i’m 5’11 / 185 lbs with an athletic build and xl fit good,
update:  after washing these,
with cheer color guard only,
"the material actually got thicker and softer feeling, and the shirt is quite comfortable",
i’m wearing it right now for the first time,
"the cuffs are extremely soft and luxurious feeling, and the shirt is nice and soft to the touch, more-so than expected",
it’s in the low 60’s right now in chicago and the shirt is perfect,
for me,
it’s still a rather thin material for a long sleeve shirt,
thus the economical price,
but it’s perfect for wearing around the house with shorts or as a layer under a jacket or warm sweater when the temps drop to the low 40’s tonight,
"the material has a nice stretchiness to it,",
"but i think it’s in the weave and not the material, which is 50/50 cotton/polyester, no mention of the common 2% lycra",
"it didn’t shrink much, if at all,  in the wash",
"they advertise that it’s preshrunk and i’d agree, and the length, both shirt and sleeve, for xl is plentiful for me at 5’11”",
"often the arms shrink and end up a little short on me unless i go up a size, so this is a nice surprise",
"jerzees didn’t skimp on the amount of, albeit thin, material",
this polo is well worth the $10 price on amazon,
"i found myself struggling most mornings to put an outfit together for work, my solution - create a uniform",
"they are durable and machine washable, which add an extra layer of convenience and they go well with a sport jacket, making them versatile",
and inexpensive,
additions to your corporate wardrobe,
super thin material,
see my photo showing how see through this is,
thank god i bought a white t-shirt for underneath,
this is for my 13 yo son who has a little weight issue,
he needs it for a orchestra concert tomorrow so i’m stuck with it and i hope the t-shirt is a good barrier,
"so if you’re not perfectly ripped and don’t want people to see your moobs or belly, don’t buy this shirt",
this is my second shirt from this style,
"i got a blue one and liked it a lot, now have a color choice",
originally wanted long sleeve protection when doing outdoor community outreach projects for a club,
for that purpose it is excellent,
it turns out to be stylish enough to wear to casual nice activities like a meal with family,
i usually end up wearing my lunch,
yesterday a blob of dressing from a sandwich wiped right off and the shirt came through the wash with no spot,
good stain protection and no wrinkles from the dryer,
fit is as expected,
just right for my xxl torso,
and finish quality is good,
very happy with this shirt,
you maybe looking at this shirt because you want to wear it for work or for everyday,
it will totally work for both,
but i needed a halloween costume,
so i purchased it 3 sizes too big and went a felicia from the movie friday,
"the color and size were as expected,",
but the shirt is pretty thin,
it wrinkles pretty easily,
it was good for summer,
the issue i usually have with polos are:,
the collar,
the sleeves,
the length,
the collar on this one was ok,
"over time though, because it is thin, i expect it will roll up at the ends, which is annoying",
"the sleeves on this are odd, which may be because of the thinness",
where the band on the end of the sleeve is sewn to the sleeve it is very pronounced,
it makes it just kind of look odd,
time will tell on the length,
"what i see usually happens is that the back of the shirt will shrink up, and the front won't",
which makes it wearable only if you tuck it in,
otherwise it gets a boxy look,
"i expect this one will do that,",
but so far it's ok,
"overall was hoping for a solid cheap polo, and was planning to buy several more",
"glad i waited and only got one to try out, because my search continues",
strange feel for a cotton/poly mix,
"the shirt is very scratchy to the point of irritation, especially around the collar",
the sleeves are ultra-tight at the wrists,
and the general shape is american -- i,
", small in the chest, big in the belly",
i originally thought all the color variations were a great feature,
but i would not buy this shirt again after purchasing just one,
"""you get what you pay for"" definitely holds true on this one",
i bought this for myself,
"i'm a 145 lb woman standing 5' 8""",
i wanted long sleeves and couldn't find this shirt in the women's dept,
i was amazed at how good the top fit in xl,
"the sleeves are nice and long and the material is a cotton blend, which makes it lightweight",
"the length of the body is long, so if you're long waisted this will fit",
it's almost too long for me as it comes down to the tops of my thighs,
"great product, i'd definitely purchase this again",
the product was of  high quality and as advertised,
"the vendor delivered timely, well packaged and performed as advertised",
i would highly recommend both the vendor and the product,
i was looking for a decent golf shirt at a good price,
the price,
$9,
seemed to be a tremendous bargain especially given the very positive reviews,
"so, i ordered one to try",
sizing was not an issue,
the problem is the material is so flimsy it's almost transparent,
in part may have been because i ordered white,
i tried to return it through amazon,
but got a message that it wasn't allowed,
"so, i donated the shirt to a charity",
darker colors may be better choice,
i think some may like this shirt,
but it wasn't what i expected,
2/22/20: my apologies to jerzees,
i got my shirts mixed up and said some things in my original review that weren't true,
"what follows is the updated, accurate assessment of their shirt",
i also upped the rating to 4 stars as i feel is appropriate,
"i ordered the kelly green polo,",
but their color palatte is off,
"it is too bright/fluorescent to be considered a true kelly green, so i'm disappointed about that",
but that's about all i'm disappointed with,
"i have to say that the shirt is constructed/stitched in a quality manner, and size-wise it fits as expected, and it's not like the shirt looks disgustingly horrible or anything",
despite the off color,
"for under $10, it's really not all that bad of a shirt",
i've paid a lot more for a lot worse in the past,
", and it represents a great value in men's clothing",
quality made,
but i feel it was a touch smallish,
no problem i always order a size larger for ts and polos as i like a longer tail to tuck in,
these aren't 100% cotton,
but are very comfortable anyway once washed,
having a little bit of synthetic fiber helps keep their shape and seems to make them last longer,
coupled with its low price i feel this is a bargain,
all in all very happy,
the shirt came quickly and it looks and feels very nice for the price,
i generally wear size xl,
but this particular shirt in xl was much too large so i exchanged it for a size l,
the cotton-polyester blend is definitely superior to 100% cotton,
this shirt can be used as uniform attire or even business casual attire if you throw on some slacks,
"i wish these came in wider array of colors, other than that, i'm very happy with this purchase",
it is not a bad product it just has some flaws,
the sizing of this shirt runs a bit large - except in the sleeve diameter below the elbow,
when you looked at this did you note the banded cuffs?  these are fairly small and the diameter of the sleeves below the elbow is fairly small as well,
i live in the south where it rarely gets very cold,
it is important to be able to adjust warmth as the day progresses by shedding layers and \or rolling up sleeves,
that is the major problem with this shirt,
it is difficult to push the sleeves up and expose forearms,
i did grab the cuff and the lower sleeve and pull until it stretched out a bit,
i was then able to push them up some,
but not as far of as comfortably as i would like,
i ordered these for my son because he has to wear a uniform to school,
they are very well made and comfortable,
i ordered a size bigger than my son usually wears because uniform shirts normally run small and my son is the size of a grown man,
they are a little too big,
but they are wearable,
the way my son is growing that might not be such a bad thing,
these shirts are true to size so don't order a size up or size down,
unfortunately due to the coronavirus pandemic i changed my mind and ended up having my son not go to school and participate in remote learning so he will never get to wear them to school this year,
hopefully next year he will have to wear the same color as this year and he can use them in the 8th grade,
i make him wear it during school hours during remote learning when he is in a class meeting on camera,
i am glad that i only ordered two,
but i got them for a great price,
i am a very happy customer and definitely recommend these shirts to everyone,
i wish it was easier to find a shirt like this for women that didn't cost 3x as much,
i usually wear an xl so i ordered a l because it was men's,
it fits just a little bigger than i'd like,
but i figured it might shrink over time,
i wear this shirt for work and i needed something that wouldn't stain and would wash and dry well,
it also needs to hold up to repeated washings since i wash my work clothes after every shift,
"i also get coffee, mocha sauce, etc on me at work and so far this shirt is holding up great",
good value for the price,
i ordered a black large and it was huge,
"at 50/50, it was not going to shrink so i exchanged it for a medium and the color to gray",
the replacement is way too small and the weight of the fabric was far less,
i give up,
it is just too much trouble buying things on line,
"now, i can't leave because of the virus",
this one will go in the goodwill box,
you absolutely cannot beat the price,
"this is a ""tee shirt"" weight - not quite as soft as a tee shirt",
but not rough by any means,
the fit is not too baggy,
but definitely big and square enough to fit a big guy,
i am 6 feet and 220 pounds with broad shoulders,
not sure how it would do if you had a big belly,
but i have a regular sized waist and the shirt fits me fine,
great for wear when a tee shirt is too informal,
but you don't want to dress up any more,
"i ordered four these shirts, in four different colors",
"i ordered a large which is normally a bit big on me,",
but a better fit than a medium,
"with these shirts the large is a bit small, not small enough to return,",
but a little smaller than i have come to expect from a men's large,
"the shirt is comfortable,",
but a bit thin,
"i have only had them for a couple washings, so i do not know how they will hold up long term",
as thin as they are i am concerned,
time will tell,
"overall, for the price they are a great shirt",
"if they hold up well, i will buy again",
"i needed this for that day, friday, where we are to wear a polo shirt and jeans",
i don't really wear polo shirts so wasn't looking to spend a lot of money on them,
i am writing this review in august having bought it the previous december,
it's fairly comfy and the fit is right,
it fits a little loose,
"but doesn't hang off me, it hangs down just the right length in my opinion",
"having run it through the wash many times now i can say it doesnt appear to have faded, and the stitching isn't falling apart either",
"honestly, for what you pay for these, i consider that to be pretty good",
i wear a large size short sleeve version and i thought xl would be a better fit w the  long sleeves it wasn't,
nice shirt for the price,
not crazy about the white shirts,
blue,
navy/electric,
maroon black pink green look great and even wear better,
"i really don't like to write reviews that are not positive,",
"but i must on this one, in that i feel i can prevent non-positive reactions when you receive yours",
"i wanted something inexpensive,",
"but decent looking for my husband, an artist, to wear on a daily basis",
this is about the most unattractive shirt in everyway that i can think of,
"it is flimsy, it's colors are dull, it looks like they took to pieces cut out the outline and sewed them together",
"that's not what they did,",
but the shirt sure looks like it,
"i was so offended, that i went through the entire return process even though they were quite inexpensive",
at $9,
00 it was not worth it,
these polo shirts fit very nicely,
i have broad shoulders and a moderately muscled chest,
i find often that shirts that fit my chest and shoulders are then too big around the waist and too long,
these jerzees polos are the exception at they fit me well in all areas and add to a slimming appearance,
i bought these as something akin to a uniform for my massage business work,
the chest and shoulder fit is trim enough to accentuate my torso shape and roomy enough to accommodate my reaching and lifting of clients during my work,
"i will order more, too, as i like these as everyday wear better than just t-shirts",
"fits as expected, and a great quality garment at this price point",
"i work in industrial sales, i love these shirts because i don't feel guilty when i get grease on them or catch the corner of a machine and put a hole in it",
the stain guard is a double edged sword,
"they don't stain easy, this is true, even after several washed the liquids just bead up and roll off without penetrating the fabric, this is also the downside for me",
the shirts don't adsorb sweat at all,
"the sweat rather stays on your skin, and leaves a icky feeling as it beads and rolls off your back",
"i've noticed after 20 or so washings it's better,",
but still not super comfortable in a hot humid environments,
"i'm forced to wear a undershirt under these, more layers, hotter,",
but helps absorb sweat,
"needed a shirt for work that was black , polo and comfortable",
"normally, when i order shirts they are made of some sort of sweaty  blend of fabric which makes it horrible to wear and hot",
not this bad boy,
"this is cotton, comfortable, professional",
but i'm not suffering the dreaded itchy fabric blues,
"a shirt that says, i am a professional",
but i'm not itchy,
"i'm a five foot one female and weigh 160 lbs, carrying most of my weight in my midsection",
i had to return the women's size large polo shirts in lieu of the men's medium,
they fit perfect,
and i love the california blue because it is more teal then it is turquoise,
they wash and wear very well,
i took them out of the dryer after the cool down cycle and there were very few wrinkles,
not even enough to iron,
"they don't seem to have shrunk, either, since they are 50% polyester and 50% cotton",
i've been searching for the right shirt for our adult team mentors for over a year,
"and from the feedback, i thought i'd try this one",
this shirt is excellent,
the fabric is super soft for wearing and yet the shape and fabric are stable,
"no wrinkles after 14 hours of wear, looks as fresh and new as when it came",
"washes up ""like new""",
"i washed one of the 8 we purchased, and could not tell which one was washed compared to the others, it retained the same fit and same quality as the not-yet-washed",
for those who want to know: it is also the right fabric for an embroidered logo,
"many shirts' weave is too loose or too tight, distorting the logo after it's stitched on",
"or after washing the shirt the logo is too loose on the tighter, shrunk fabric",
"the aspect was my biggest concern when i purchased them: would this shirt work great for a stitched logo?  we took it to our embroiderer and the resultant logo is crisp, clean, not distorted",
in a word: perfect,
even after washing multiple times,
the background fabric is major component to achieving a beautiful logo,
this shirt exceeded my expectations,
"for ""fit"" i compared the medium to the large, and the difference is 1"" extra inch on either shoulder, and 1-1/2"" longer",
the shirt is not tapered and fits the adult body that is not quite as slim as he/she used to be perfectly,
"if you are wavering in sizes between m and l, if the person is a skinny, pick the m, it will fit without the bulk of extra fabric around the waist",
i'll be back for more shorts as our team expands,
very happy,
i feel reviews are super important to help other online shoppers,
"with that being said, i read reviews of this shirt and it was highly rated so i decided to purchase two in white",
"however, when my order arrived, i was extremely disappointed with the material quality",
these shirts are super thin and you can see through them,
my son tried one on and you could see the color of his nipples through them,
very disappointed since i have other jerzees shirts and have been happy with them,
this is a fine shirt,
"it looks good, it fits well, it seems to hold up to repeated washings",
"the navy color is very close to what's pictured, and the fabric feels better than what you expect from a poly blend",
"however, there is a very strong chemical smell that has persisted through multiple washings",
maybe it's a fire retardant coating or something to do with the spot shield marketing,
"whatever it is, the smell lingers on other clothes stacked on or near the shirts",
that alone will keep me from buying another copy of this shirt,
"i'm 5'8"" and got the medium",
fit is good overall,
but the sleeves are too tight,
not so tight as to ruin the shirt,
but a little annoying,
"so the medium is a bit small on me overall,",
but i'm sure the large would be too large,
as with most shirts,
fabric is a tiny bit on thin side,
but not enough to be a problem,
"i like the comfortably collared polo fabric better,",
"but as of this date, those are available in very few colors",
so glad i got these for my son that is 5ft 135pds i got the small because hes 10 yr old built like a 13 yr old,
its hard finding the perfect fit,
but these are that perfect fit,
they are long and the collar isnt to big like usual mens shirts on a kid,
toatally awsome for those football defense built boys,
the quality is pretty good for what you’re spending,
i bought a couple of these for a job uniform,
they wash and wear well,
"i thought it may shrink after first wash,",
but not at all,
what i like most is they don’t really get dirty or wet,
"literally spilled some of my lunch onnthe shirt when someone accidentally bumped me, and it didn’t leave a stain on it when i cleaned myself off",
"also, i got caught up working outside when it started pouring rain and the shirt didn’t really even get soaked and barely wet",
rain drops beaded up onnthe shirt,
"when i got out of the rain, i pulled the shirt off and shook it",
and the beaded up rain drops just fell/flew off,
"will definitely buy a few more soon, so i won’t  have to wear any of my ‘nicer’ polos to work anymore",
i bought this one for my husband,
"the price was very cheap so we were hesitating about the quality,",
"but we decided to try with a black one, he loved it so much because is like wearing a t-shirt",
"but with a bit more style, we are leaving in texas, the fabric is awesome for being comfortable in a hot weather",
"so after the black one, we bought a charcoal one, we confirmed it was following the same standards of the black one, then we decided to buy more colors and an extra black",
"now he is plenty of these polos, he can wear them for going to office and for the weekends, he can wear them with jeans, with dockers or more formal pants and those fit with everything",
i've bought a half-dozen of these shirts in various colors and love them,
"very comfortable, and perfect for winter in arizona",
daytime highs in 50s and 60s,
"i'm 6'5"", and take a 36"" sleeve in dress shirts, and these shirts",
xl size,
are long enough in both the body and sleeves without needing tall sizes,
no shrinkage to speak of after multiple washings,
two thumbs up,
"my teen son, who is on the autism spectrum, is extremely picky about fabrics, so i don't often buy clothing online for him",
"however, he had to have slightly dressier shirts than his usual screen print t-shirts for a trip with his school, and so i ordered him a few polo shirts from amazon",
"this particular shirt was so soft, so comfortable, that he texted me the first day he wore it in europe to thank me for buying ""the green collared shirt",
""" thank you, jerzees",
some of the reviews with pictures show tears in the fabric and claim it was very cheap,
but my experience has not been as such,
my job requires us to wear polos to work and cover up tattoos so these longsleeve polos have been fantastic,
"i own the black navy and gray ones and they're comfortable despite being 50% polyester, which mind you is definitely not the most comfortable material",
but this feels fine,
"i only ever use these for work,",
but if you want to go out and look a little better than just a casual t-shirt these also look fantastic,
i've bought polos where the wrist tends to be too loose,
but this one hugs around it very nicely and gives it a nice fit,
"so far so good, definitely ordering more",
"i’m not very impressed with this shirt,",
but you get what you pay for,
the quality is meh- okay as a back up when my better shirts are in the wash,
"thin enough that you can see my tattoos thru the sleeves, so maybe use that in making a decision",
this is a very nice looking white polo shirt,
the thickness is perfect,
it is comfortable and thick enough so it is not see-through,
the stitching is well done and this shirt has held up nicely in the wash,
the collar does not curl  in the wash which is really nice,
it seems to be stain resistant,
the fit is true to size,
i purchased it for someone who is 6 ft 5 and it fits him perfectly,
this is a high-quality shirt,
i paid about $8,
50 for this polo shirt from amazon,
it is 50% cotton / 50% polyester,
"overall,  the shirt fits as expected and is a great value for the price",
don't pretend you didn't know what you were getting,
of course 100% cotton is more breathable,
it also shrinks,
the 50/50 blend does not and the shirt feels just fine,
i work in warehouse where the men are expected to wear collared shirts,
it is almost summer and it is getting very hot,
i wanted to get some polo shirts that were more of a t-shirt fabric,
this polo is very thin and semi see through,
but its exactly what i needed for its intended purpose,
i didn't want to purchase your traditional polo that is usually thicker,
this polo is definitely light and still looks great,
i don't have to wear an under shirt because since it is light and more of a t-shirt material it does not irritate my skin or make me itch,
i recommend this polo if you want to still look semi business casual,
i washed them with my other work clothing and dried them on a delicate setting,
low heat,
it didn't shrink that much,
but i'm not sure how much it will shrink if you dry on a different dryer setting,
good-looking long sleeve white polo shirt,
i bought this for someone who is hard to size,
he is 6 ft 5 in and lifts weights,
this fit well in the chest and in the waist,
usually if it fits the chest then the waist is big,
but this was just right,
it is been washed and it has held its shape nicely and remains nice and white,
the quality on the shirt is terrific and the thickness of the material is nice,
i ordered 5 of these for the summer,
i've had them for about 3 months,
i wear each one about once a week,
they're already showing significant wear and pills everywhere,
you do have to iron them,
"this is very disappointing, especially because i hang dry them",
next summer i'll definitely spend more money to buy a higher quality material that will last more than 1 season,
i doesn't shrink around the neck causing an uncomfortable restriction around the neck,
"the full coverage prevents sunburn,especially on the back of the neck",
this shirt is made from thin material so it's fine for cool weather,
thicker fabric is sometimes is often too hot for fall/spring,
fits great,
i also splashed some food on it and it came off without being absorbed,
"have not washed it yet, so this feature may change over time",
"the price is low, so my expectations are modest",
"i don't quite know why i bought these shirts in a 50% cotton blend when what i needed was a 100% synthetic, moisture wicking fabric",
"and sure enough, it goes to show, cotton drags down a fabric's performance in summertime heat and humidity,",
but synthetics save the day,
"with full-on synthetic shirts, sweat doesn't show, and it's drawn away to the outside where it can evaporate",
almost any stains will disappear after a few washings,
and they dont fade,
they last years and years even with daily use,
these shirts approximate all that,
"but they are hotter on, they will stain, they do show sweat, and they are heavier and more stifling than i am used to",
"and the whole evaporative cooling effect that makes me go ""aaaah",
""" when the slightest breeze comes along just isn't there",
these are more for light indoor work with only occasional outdoor exposure,
"this is a good, standard polo shirt",
"it's good quality, not too heavy, great for summer",
the price is good for what you get,
"i like my casual shirts on the loose side, and this one does not run large at all",
"i would order jerzees again, if i needed another polo shirt",
i ordered this polo size medium for my husband who is 5'9 and about 160 pounds,
the pros:,
i love the deep forest green of this shirt and that it comes in a variety of colors,
my husband said that it is very comfortable and he wears in regularly,
the cons:,
"this shirt did shrink a bits,",
but that is to be expected from a shirt that is 100% cotton,
the shirt seems to shrink length wise rather than width wise,
the fabric feels cheap,
it isn't soft,
fit perfectly and i am kinda skinny so it's hard to find shirts that aren't too big,
but aren't so small i have to pull my shirt out of my armpit and pull my shirt below my tummy and my crack,
teehee,
i pretty much only buy this brand for myself anymore because they last at least a few years since i bought my first one almost 3 years ago and i wear a single one of the several i have at least once a week,
i will buy more,
"i have several of these shirts, and they’re all great",
really good “uniform” shirts,
vibrant colors,
"good, comfortable fit",
stain and spot resistance,
"but, the kicker with this particular shirt is",
i didn’t receive this shirt,
"what i got was the long sleeve version, in a package labeled ‘short sleeve’",
"it’s a good shirt, and i was considering getting a long sleeve or two anyway",
i even double checked my order just to be sure i didn’t select the incorrect item,
nope,
just the wrong shirt in the right package,
things happen,
happy accident,
this product was defective,
i purchased it for a gift,
"the fabric is thin,  it arrived doubled bag",
inside bag had previously been torn open,
it's defective,
"i an not reordering, due to quality if fabric and appearance",
"surprisingly, it was a lot harder to find and expensive",
this product was a small fraction of what other companies wanted and honestly is perfectly fine,
"it is durable enough to wear once a month when he serves and doesn't look ""cheap""",
it is slightly bigger than what he expected,
but not terribly big,
we would recommend the shirt to anyone who is need of these specifics,
i'm not into logos on my clothes so i really like these they're very comfortable like a t-shirt with the collar,
"ordered the black it was a different fit the first few were tagless this was not ,kinda disappointed don't think i will be ordering anymore of these",
seller was amazon picture misleading,
tried to get ahold of a real person to send what's pictured,
impossible,
great value for this shirt,
i am ordering more in different colors,
made well,
fabric is lightweight,
but that is exactly what i wanted for the warm nevada weather,
"the sizing is as stated, the size i got is a 4x-large and it is just like most other 4x-l from american companies such as hanes, duluth trading post, etc",
i always wash my clothes in cold water and dry on low heat so i do not expect any shrinkage,
"the shirt arrived stuffed in a tiny box about 4"" x 4"" x 7""",
"when i opened the box, i noted that the shirt appeared to have been ""rebagged""",
"the shirt fit fairly loosely,",
"but  looking in the mirror, i could see my chest hair right through the shirt",
"it is made of very thin material, and feels no thicker than a lightweight undershirt",
i've purchased better quality shirts from vendors for &lt,
$5 previously on manhattan street corners,
"i should have returned it,",
but waited too long,
don't waste your money,
it's good when its new,
"but after few washes, it looks really old",
wont buy again,
ordered a medium for my girlfriend as a work shirt &amp,
she likes her tops bigger/looser,
well she's 5'7 &amp,
just under 150lbs &amp,
the medium fits perfect,
it falls just to her hips &amp,
wasn't too big,
"it was smaller for a medium though, should have ordered her a large for a better more comfortable fit",
but these shirts do run a bit smaller,
"nice quality, decent shirt for the price",
would buy again just know i'd size up if you are looking to buy,
shirt is a great bargain for the price,
it is not misrepresented in any way,
it is a thin shirt with a polo style collar that is very comfortable to wear,
if you want a heavy traditional polo please look elsewhere,
but for the money you will not be disappointed in this shirt,
i ordered one to try then ordered four more,
"i'm a busty 5'8"" female with really large arms",
i have a very difficult time finding shirts that fit my chest and arms without being like a moo-moo in my stomach area,
most women's shirts have super tight sleeves,
these shirts are perfect,
"fits well through the chest and abdomen - not tight, not too loose",
and the sleeves are perfect in length and width,
they go to my elbow and don't slide up when i move my arms,
absolutely love these shirts and bought one in almost every color,
"i was looking for inexpensive cotton polo shirts to wear in the winter, primarily under other layers",
"the shirt would not need to be super fancy, only comfortable",
"this shirt, though very plain, is exactly what i was looking for",
it is also tagless which adds to the comfort level,
"this shirt has a nice long tail, so it stays tucked in",
i would not recommend this shirt for wearing untucked,
really happy with my 2 new jerzees polo sport shirts,
tried both on and they both fit well and are just what i wanted,
"cuffs are snug which is good, just right, some shirts have very wide loose cuffs which i don't care for, i find loose cuffs unattractive",
"got both shirts with long sleeves which i want, prefer these kind of shirts with long sleeves",
quality shirts at a decent price,
you can't go wrong,
"i ordered a m and it is true to size,",
"but very, very long",
i will update once i wash it to say whether it shrinks at all,
"for the price, i'd say it's a pretty decent shirt",
"not totally see through, it is a pretty comfy material and the collar isn't stiff and weird like some shirts",
my husband needed 3 white polos,
i ordered these because i was pleased with the stainguard,
once received they felt a little thin,
i ordered 3 more of a different brand and tried to return these,
they say they are not eligible for return,
"i purchased them 2 weeks ago so time is not the reason, just they are not ""eligible for return""",
i would have never have purchased them if i knew they were a final sale,
i would recommend skipping this seller/product altogether,
bad business,
great shirt for an even better price,
"they really are ""spot resistant"" and even water doesn't stain them",
"it collects as little droplets on the shirt, looks pretty cool and reduces dampness after rain/spills/etc",
"colors are vibrant, fit is perfect for tucking in or leaving untucked",
"i bought 4 of them for use at work, doing a relatively physical job, and they've held up great and maintained their appearance",
"they're breathable too, which is an added bonus",
highly recommended,
i ordered these for my husband for work,
he works in a factory and he really likes them,
"they are very comfortable, don't wrinkle easily and don't show sweat",
"our only complaint is that they collect lint like crazy, so if that matters to you buy a lint roller to go with them",
the shirt is good quality with a great color that i have been complimented on already in its first use today,
the only issue is i noticed that if i wash these shirts and purely hang dry as i normally do the shirts run a little bigger than normal for a large,
but its not to the point where its extra large size,
so my tip is to wash and use a dryer once then hand dry from that point on,
"this could be my mistake, or my body",
the shirt fit reasonably well except for that fact that it was very tight through the chest area,
"i may try a medium versus the small size i purchased,",
but i suspect that would be a little too big all around,
the shirt appears to be good quality,
"i like the shirt, and it is mostly comfortable,",
but i don't have broad enough shoulders for the amount of space that they have for the top of the sleeves,
this causes the sleeves to sag down until the end of the sleeves are at my elbows,
i have to occasionally pull up the sleeves so they are at the right height,
not as silky as underarmor,
but very good for a cotton blend,
pretty soft,
"update- i bought two more, one royal blue, the other true red",
the colors are bright,
but they have def changed them,
they are def thinner and not as soft,
sleeve cuffs are tighter,
its too bad they changed,
not as good,
still not bad for the price,
real cheap,
"however, it dropped them from 4 stars to 3 stars",
these shirts are the equivalent of t-shirts with a collar,
their cost and material is comparable,
why wear a classless t-shirts when a nice polo leaves a better first impression,
the shirts lack any branded logo which is good for those who refuse to advertise over priced brands,
buy half a dozen and you will be set for the summer,
i order these shirts for my son,
they are good quality and perfect for his it job,
he is 6foot tall and they fit ok in length,
but great around waist,
they are not too thick so he can wear an undershirt and still stay cool,
will be ordering more,
very thin fabric,
but it was inexpensive and came in the purple color that is the uniform color for the high school where my husband works as a teacher,
"even though he can wear what he wants most days because he is a teacher, not a student, he likes to wear the school uniform fairly often",
"even when it is not a ""spirit day""",
as a positive role model for the kids who often seem to try to get away with wearing something other then the required uniform,
bought this for my 19 year old son to wear for our family christmas photo shoot,
it looked great in the photos and fit him perfectly,
almost everything we wore for our photo shoot was ordered last minute on amazon and arrived in time,
to cheap,
its like a teeshirt only is polo,
don't know where you would wear a product like this,
"these are cheap, and compared to a $30-$60 polo you will notice the difference",
"the material is rough, and they make you sweat alot",
and i work sitting down all day,
they do get the job done though,
"for reference im 5’9, 260lbs and i wear an xl which fits me just right, not too big or small",
evn though i always toss them in the drier they don’t shrink which is another plus,
the quality of this shirt supersedes the price by far,
i have a larger chest and back for my frame so i usually need a large,
"however, the sleeves on a large are usually a bit long or loose",
"the medium fits a little snug,",
but not enough to make me look like i've got something to prove,
"while this isn't the perfect shirt, it's great for a wash and toss on",
"i bought it for my husband and after several washed i've noticed no fading, pilling, or shrinking",
"it doesn't wrinkle, and he likes to wear it to work as a ""beat it up"" shirt",
the collar is my only complaint,
it's soft and will curl if you don't watch it so if that's not an issue for you this is a good purchase,
you can't beat the price,
i bought several of these shirts last year for my husband for christmas,
he likes them so much he asked for more this year for christmas,
the shirts do not shrink when washed and dried,
after wearing and being washed and dried for a year they look as they did when i bought them,
"me encanta esta camiseta tipo polo, es muy cómoda un poco mas suelta, la tela se siente bien, estoy satisfecho con la prenda a pesar de estar en una temperatura tropical promedio de 30 grados centígrados, la recomiendo si te gusta vestir con ropa que no este ajustada, en mi caso en particular mido 1",
"80 metros y mi peso es de 211 libras, y me siento genial con la compra, recomendada",
"i was very surprised at the quality of these shirts, i was not expecting them to be so long",
but i haven't worn a shirt tucked in in ages,
gave it a trial run and found out they do indeed stay tucked,
"very pleased with the purchase, just have to get used to wearing a tucked shirt again",
i bought 2 of these for my husband who is a 2x large,
he's very picky about how a shirt feels on his skin and he's hard on shirts,
these fit the bill in both areas,
they are very sturdy,
but still soft enough to make him happy,
"the only issue was the seam on the cuffs of the sleeves scratching him, which he remedied by folding them up to the seems",
i couldn't even tell he did it,
they fit him perfectly,
i ordered the black and purple,
"the black is a nice dark black and the purple is a bright, vibrant purple",
"they match several shorts and pants of his, giving him options of either a playful casual look or something more dressy",
i'll probably buy a couple more,
"the fit is good, not tight, not too long",
"i am 5’8”, 195lbs",
"not skinny,",
but not huge,
i ordered a large,
the sleeves are a little long they come the full length of my upper arm and they should stop mid bicep or a little longer,
"the material is thin, so a decent warm weather shirt",
also it is a 50/50 blend so it shouldn’t shrink,
"so for $9 or so,  not a bad buy and i can get the sleeves tailored",
i’m 5’3 and a girl i got this for a job it’s a little long,
but it still looks badass it’s not too long just a few inches below the stomach like 2-4 inches,
the arms fit as labeled tho and it’s a bit thick which isn’t bad it’s not heavy,
i got size small i weight around 135-140 and it still looks good,
lots of compliments from other women,
can't beat these long sleeve polo shirts for the price,
"with fall arriving, i needed to switch from short sleeve to longer sleeve polo shirts and bought 4 of these jerzee's long sleeve polos",
quality is good,
fit is perfect,
"i am 6'1"", 180 lbs and a large fits perfectly",
price is amazing,
i highly recommend this shirt,
"i love the fabric, it washes beautifully",
"i am a woman and i bought this for me, i am tall and i have long arms, women's long sleeve shirts sometimes have sleeves that are too short",
"this is perfect, just wish there were more colors",
this shirt was delivered quickly and on time,
"arrived in plastic bag, did have some wrinkling,",
but after steaming and let hang went away,
"shirt was purchased because job required a basic white shirt with no logos, and all my shirts had logos",
so this was meant to be basic and it is exactly that,
fit as described,
true to size,
tagless which was nice,
el producto nunca llegó,
es un restaurante y tiene empleados trabajando desde las 8am,
"supuestamente fue entregado a las 2,30 pm en pleno trabajo pero no fue así",
no fue entregado,
"quiero saber que fue lo qué pasó, a donde fue que lo entregaron, etc",
"necesito que lo envíen y lo entreguen en la dirección que está especificada en el pedido, a nombre de la persona que se pidió, o que reintegren el dinero",
después de tener una respuesta podré cambiar mi opinión,
these shirts fit oerfect i was having trouble finding my son who is 13,
but built like a line backer school shirts and these saved the day affordable right size and did not shrink when washed which was an important factor for us,
"one would expect a polo-type shirt of this quality to run at least $24, if not more",
how they pull this off for $12,
"95, i'll never know,",
but suffice it to say i am well pleased with this purchase and would highly recommend it to anyone in the market,
these shirts run a bit large,
i ordered another one and i sized it down this time and i am going to see how it fits,
"i haven't washed this bigger size one yet,",
but i still think even after washing it's going to be a bit large,
i can wear it around the house when mowing grass and such so it's all good,
they are thin and really cool during our hot summer weather,
ordered this one becausevyhe last one ofvyhe same color developed an area of grey on my chest,
for a maroon shirt that is not good,
have had several shirts from this company that have developed off color spots in past,
the fabric wasn't quite what i expected,
it has the texture of a medium-weight t-shirt,
"despite that, it still looks good and fits the way i thought it would",
"if it proves to be durable and stain-resistant, then it's an amazing deal",
"if not, it's still a good deal",
my husband is very particular about his clothes,
"he’s very happy with the weight, feel of the fabric, and the ease of laundering",
"we only partially dry in the dryer, then hang for the shirts to finish drying",
we have ordered him several more in other colors,
"what i like best about this shirt is that it is made from great quality heavy material, not that crap that gets snagged on anything that you walk by",
"very comfortable, and great fit",
"i guess if you order the right size, it'll fit fine",
right?,
great shirts,
"you look professionally dressed wearing these with casual pants whether you're at home, answering the door, getting the mail, newspaper, etc",
"without looking like one of the ""covid confined""",
for the price these are great shirts,
"bought them to use for work, love the comfort there really soft",
obviously not the polo brand,
but for a fraction of the price definetly good,
i own 3 already and plan on purchasing more,
wanted a long sleeve polo shirt,
fits the bill,
warmth &amp,
comfort,
"i got this shirt for hubby for christmas, since shopping in person is so dangerous and stressful right now",
"it is a decent shirt,",
but not as soft as the polos from kohl's,
"but  hubby likes it, so it's all good",
i'm a big fan of black polos,
but i'm not a fan of color fading,
"at this price, if they fade i can afford to buy a new one every month",
i prefer a slimmer fit,
broad back,
but this is fine,
i would also prefer shorter sleeves,
these go down almost to my elbow,
"other than those minor gripes, i'm pleased",
love it,
will purchase more for my boyfriend 🙂,
this shirt is a good value for the money,
but they run small,
my husband ordinarily wears a large,
but as luck would have it i ordered him an xl and it fit him nicely,
on the other hand the xl did not fit my son,
who is a tad larger,
i was going to return one of the xl's,
but the seller was only going to give me a little over $3,
00 for the shirt,
"instead, i am going to keep it and give it to someone who can use it",
i love these shirts,
"they are bright, don't shrink in the wash and fit perfectly after i received them",
"i am male, 6' tall and have a 38"" waste so the xl size fit to a tee",
pun intended,
i will most likely purchase more and recommend these shirts,
i bought a few different shirts like this for him to wear to work,
they are sized correctly,
but the sleeves do seem longer than they should be,
these are great choice for him since he works in a cigar shop and they stand up well to a good washing to get that cigar smell out,
"first, there is a problem with the review process",
"there is the question: ""how does this product fit?""",
"only one answer is accepted, so i'll just say it here",
this shirt is both too small,
in some dimensions,
and too large,
in other dimensions,
"for example, going up the sleeve, it binds at the bottom, and it hangs way down your side at the top",
"love the color, price, and fit my husband just right",
"this polo is a pretty good shirt, the fit is pretty good, and i really like how it repels water, the material is slightly thicker than an average t shirt, so it's not a heavyweight shirt,",
"but it had withstood several washes already, so i'm pretty happy with it",
it repels water and sweat well,
haven't tested any oily stains though,
it didn't shrink when i washed it,
and dried on low,
"""pre-shrunk"" claim seems accurate",
it fits well,
"it feels different from most shirts, probably because of the hydrophobic coating",
it's comfortable enough though,
i bought this polo because i had a jersey polo for several years that fits great,
but was wearing out,
i'm glad to say that their sizing template is still very close to what it was years ago,
"buying clothes as a tall slender person sucks, most clothes are made for short and/or fat people",
"if you need a longer length shirt or sleeve you have to go up a size, which almost always means they add several inches to the waist and then you end up with a puffy shirt that drapes and flaps off you",
this is the only brand of polo what i've found that fits good and has a long length and a tight fit,
"the fabric is pretty good,",
but could be a bit softer,
overall i feel very comfortable wearing this polo,
love these shirts,
"they're comfortable, fit well and are affordable",
you can't go wrong with these imo,
"love these shirts, they are true to their size, unlike other companies that are a size too small and short",
"the colors are awesome, they feel so comfortable and feel like they will last a long time",
"they have not shrunk when i wash them, just love them",
so will you try them,
excellent lightweight winter long sleeve shirt,
"they wash well, fit perfectly, and hold up well",
and they come at a great price,
and they're long enough,
can't ask for more,
5 stars,
"unfortunately, it hasn’t even been a year and the shirts are falling apart",
one shirt has a hole in the back,
the sleeve stitching on another shirt is coming undone,
the fabric on one shirt is wearing out near the collar making my undershirt visible,
"its really comfortable after many uses, it's a great shirt to use for work related purposes",
if you want to go out to a special occasion i would recommend a more slim fit shirt than this one,
this shirt is not slim fit,
but it's not too lose,
i work at a starbucks and this shirt does not inhibit your arm movement at all,
highly recommend,
this shirt fits as reasonably expected,
"i went through one of these in a year and a half,",
but it got a big hole in it,
"i bought this as a replacement shirt, since i needed it for work at a piano studio",
thank you for comfort,
i bought it for my son for work and he likes it,
"the colors are bold, the shirt is comfortable and it is long enough for his 6 foot 3 body",
"it may be a little thin,",
but nothing unusual,
a good buy - we are very happy,
i enjoy this brand of shirt alot,
love the fit and the purpose of use,
good shirt collar and cup sleeves,
the bottom cut and design works well if you need to do security work and you have ccw license / permit,
holds up well through machine washings and bounces back,
i will be ordering more in the future,
my husband loves this shirt,
it fits him just right  not too long &amp,
not too short,
"this shirt stays inside the back of his jeans so when he bends over, he doesn't have to stand up and adjust his jeans &amp",
retuck his shirt in,
thank you~,
"for the cheap cheap price, don't have many complaints",
"my son got a new job that required green polos, this fit the bill when we had no extra money and got him working",
"they're not very soft and are thin,",
but look professional enough for the workplace,
ordered for cool weather sleep shirt,
serves its purpose,
"i don't think it would hold up well to the wear and tear of normal, non-sleep wear",
thin material,
"but for what i needed it for, does great",
love this polo style shirt which meets my needs,
it looks sharp and the price is in the right place,
the fit of the shirt is fine and the looks are great,
"for the price, i did not expect much and this isn't top quality by any means",
"i knew from other reviews that the material was thin, so that was no surprise",
i am disappointed that it is so rough textured,
i expected it to be softer,
"anyway, you get what you pay for",
i will say,
"i am 5'10""/205,  i bought a large and it fits fine after washing",
my husband is happy with his new shirts,
he got the xl and they fit great,
he wears for work,
he does wish shirts were a little heavier for cooler weather,
washes well and fabric stays soft,
good quality product,
i am a big large,
sometimes i have to wear extra large,
this shirt in a large size fit me well and did not shrink when i dried it,
the fit us generous and it truly is stain resistant,
"feels good, fits well",
i am a husky size,
washes very easy and dries fast,
great for a fishing trip or golf outing and all at a great price,
bought two for my oldest son,
but in millennial colors,
i like to take my shirts right out of the dryer and not have to iron them,
"these come close,",
but still just a little wrinkled,
"not bad, still a good deal for me",
a staple for my son’s school uniform,
they was well and didn’t shrink,
i ordered this long sleeve shirt last week and it arrived as a short sleeve shirt,
i sent it back and they were very quick to send out another shirt,
this shirt was also a short sleeve even know the ad reads long sleeve,
the small white label on the clear wrapper also states that it is a long sleeve,
obviously miss labeled merchandise,
"once they fix the problem, i will buy it again",
"good product, received on time, good price, satisfied with the quality, thankyou",
fits and washes great,
he wears these year round and they hold up really well,
when i get them at this price i buy them in every color i know he will wear,
this turquoise color is going to be great for our trip to miami/nassau,
i told him he will blend in with the water,
"i work at a car rental business and we are in and out a lot, so it's a given that this thing is perfect for the winter",
it will keep the water away surprisingly well,
the main reason i'm five-starring this is i'm a skinny guy and the neck fits perfectly as well as the length of the sleeves,
i'm 6'3 145lbs,
this shirt is an excellent winter shirt for the colder weather,
highly recommended from jerzees,
"when you buy a cheap product, you cannot expect the stars",
"now, these shirts don't feel cheap and fit fine - i will go one size smaller, next time",
i bought them for yard work and i cannot complain,
"yet, i would not wear them to a paartay",
pretty good overall for my kid's school required outfits,
but a little on the thin side almost see thru and kid's don't want to wear undershirts too,
they're wearable tho,
these jerzes shirts are exactly as ordered,
they are a cotton blend knit,
not that slick moisture wicking kind,
they wash and dry very nicely plus they were very reasonable in price,
this product looks exactly like the picture,
the color is deep and rich,
it fits as expected,
my 12 year old son says it’s comfy,
"he washes his clothes and he’s not managed to shrink, discolor, or alter the texture",
that is amazing,
"bought the large for my son who is  6' 1"", 160 lbs",
it fits him well,
arm length is excellent and not baggy in the torso,
will have to see how it holds up after a few washes,
shirt fit fine,
"what i liked about the shirts was that not only were they wrinkle free,",
but it fit as expected,
"as always with the brand, it is top notch material",
however they aren't stain resistant,
"nice shirt, just a lot thinner and lighter than i expected",
fit's pretty much as expected,
interested to see how it holds up over time,
they fit as expected and waiting on the was to see if they soften up,
they are a bit rough feeling,
could just be me,
but over all worth the price,
"thin material, a bit larger than expected",
but overall decent quality,
sleeves are a little longer than other polo shirts i purchased,
but that may be because the whole shirt runs a bit large as i mentioned,
i ordered this shirt from the 2nd party seller,
i was very careful to read reviews before buying,
when the shirt arrived i tried it on,
"it was 2"" narrower than their size chart said it was",
"in addition, the sleeves were as tight as women's panty hose",
contacted the seller about their defective merchandise,
but they were no help,
"paid to ship it back, lesson learned",
"bought this for my 12 year old in a size small, navy",
it will fit him just fine with some room to grow into,
while not looking sloppy,
i took off a star because this long sleeve is quite thin,
i ordered long sleeve shirts for the winter months,
something to consider if you are purchasing these for a cold climate,
"i wear a xtra large, i'm 6'4""",
it fits like it should,
"it's good quality, worth the money",
it repels water,
but it also keeps body heat in,
overall a great buy,
just what i wanted,
"the fabric is very lightweight,",
"but entirely opaque, so it is a great warm weather shirt",
"did not realize the band at the bottom of the sleeves would be slightly smaller than the sleeves themselves- not really a problem,",
but when i put the shirt on i need to pull the sleeves down,
they seem to stay in place just fine afterwards,
looks and fits great,
i bought this for my husband for christmas and it looks great on him,
the color is nice and it washes great,
this long sleeve fit perfectly and worked out great for my job interview,
i ended up actually getting the job so i’m really glad i went with this as my outfit of choice,
beautiful color,
comfy,
washer and dryer easy without shrinking,
medium weight: may be too heavy for extreme summer heat,
"my son lives in his shirts: for work and for errands, hikes, hanging out",
dress up or down,
affordable,
available in basic colors in a 2-pack,
what's not to like?,
i use these shirts for casual wear in the winter here in the south,
"after having washed these shirts several times, i have not had any problems with fading, discoloration or wear issues like tearing or unraveling",
"however, i hang them to dry to prevent shrinkage",
"overall, i love these shirts, i have bought seven in total",
"bought this shirt for my son for school, and their uniform calls for either short sleeve or long sleeve white polo shirt",
but because he's growing we didn't want to spend too much money,
but needed to buy several so he has at least one for each day and on days where he has phys-ed he has a second,
the shirts fit as expected and barely shrank when washed,
we normally wash all whites separately and don't use bleach,
but something designed for white clothes,
"the shirt may need ironing,",
but it's expected,
we also replace his shirts every year because at what they cost it's simply worth it,
"these are well made, fit nicely and snug",
"great for cool and winter wear in the desert southwest and go with, jeans, dockers type pants, wrangler wranchers",
have several colors and color washes well and doesn't fade,
this is not dry fit,
it is a cotton polo,
and just like everyone says it does run large,
i’m 6’0 185 pound athletic build,
generally a large this is a medium and still a little big,
i bought these to keep the sun off my arms when out riding my bicycle in the summer months,
i don't like using sun screen all over my exposed parts as it feels like a gooey mess,
these shirts also give motorists a better view of me when i am out on my bike,
i bought 3 to see how they fit and am very happy with them and ordered 3 more so i don't run out between washing cycles,
they fit nicely as expect in the label,
perfect for miami,
hard to find a light weight long sleeve polo shirt at a great price,
fits roomy so you might need to check size carefully,
washes well,
i bought a variety of colors,
great buy,
highly recommended,
"i bought 5 of these in several colors, for me after two years of casual use they are holding up well and are still in use",
"however, they have never been soft no matter how much downy i use and after a",
while they tend to feel itchy,
i still use them as i have not found a good substitute yet,
these long sleeve shirts fit great,
"i'm  a 2xl , the shirt fits great with a bit of room to spare",
the colors look great and my wife thinks  i look great in them,
i've purchased 2 of these shirts and ready to order more,
great gift for a young man,
"the color is a very dark navy, and the sleeves are long enough even after washing it the first timer",
"it held its shape well, too",
when they arrived they smelled absolutely terrible and gross,
"i've no idea how that kind of thing happens,",
"but it smelled like they were soaked in vinegar and piss for 5 days, dried, and immediately sent to my home",
i often tire of wearing a t-shirt for home office use and this was a perfect balance of comfort and style,
doesn't wrinkle and fits well,
i enjoy wearing this,
perfect size fits like i like it,
"soft cotton, this shirt is comfortable and finally, a shirt where the sleeves fit like they should",
one thing to be careful about is the colors,
"this is much more of a bright blue than what is in the picture,",
"but for the comfort, it provides this is minor",
buy with confidence,
this polo runs really small -,
"while i'm typically on the border of small and medium, i ordered a small and it was skin tight",
"also, the fabric is really light weight and in my opinion not very good quality",
seems jerzees makes good quality sweatshirts,
but not polos,
my son wears these as part of his school uniform,
they are his favorite,
"the fabric is soft and sturdy, unlike ones that we’ve bought from other brands",
"the shirt is a little longer too, which helps it stay tucked in",
the shirts are what i expected,
i ordered one in blue and one in black,
i like the fit with the exception of the length of the sleeve,
which i am able to alter and did,
other than that,
i am satisfied,
"i actually bought these for my boyfriend, he needed new shirts for work and the ones he ordered from another site weren’t coming in time",
he finds them really comfortable and nice fabric,
i ordered the black shirts,
the fabric feels scratchy and cheap,
"the color isn't a nice dark black, they already look faded",
they will do for now,
but i will have to buy more because these will just not cut it,
"bought this shirt for my son for school, and their uniform calls for either short sleeve or long sleeve white polo shirt",
but because he's growing we didn't want to spend too much money,
but needed to buy several so he has at least one for each day and on days where he has phys-ed he has a second,
the shirts fit as expected and barely shrank when washed,
we normally wash all whites separately and don't use bleach,
but something designed for white clothes,
"the shirt may need ironing,",
but it's expected,
we also replace his shirts every year because at what they cost it's simply worth it,

these are very well made and comfortable shirts,
they wash well and the color is holding up very nicely after several months of washing,
nice shirts for those cool golf mornings in az in the winter,
i wear a top n over it when 40-50 degrees then peel it off to this shirt as day warms,
i’m usually a 2xltall,
but in these 2x fits best,
size was as expeted,
looked real nice,
did not feel or look cheap,
i'm happy with this and plan on ordering another color,
these look kind of sloppy and wrinkly and t shirt material,
they're ok if you a'rent trying to look good,
they werr inexpensive and sometimes you get what you pay for,
"it’s big, baggy and netted",
my husband usually wears large so that’s what i ordered,
this shirt doens him and it doesn’t seem very durable,
"i can easily see the stitching, threading and fibers of the fabric - it’s like looking at a net",
i’m honestly afraid to wash it because the quality is so poor,
but i guess that’s what you get for under $9 bucks,
"for the most part, i love these shirts",
"the spot shield still works even after several washes, i haven't noticed any shrinking of the material",
why a 4 star instead of the 5 star,
"honestly, it's b/c there wasn't any offerings for the tall, &amp",
it's a bit short for my long torso,
"they feel great, look good, &amp",
wear pretty well even if they are a bit short for me,
fantastic,
fast delivery,
great jacket,
totally happy,
just hate the fact that amazon is so liberal tempted not to use again,
"you get what your pay for, not much",
"disappointed, we were hoping for jerzee thickness, quality and comfort",
this ain't it,
returned instantly,
great shirt for my husband,
wrinkle free with cool moisture wicking,
kept my husband cool and comfortable,
i was hoping for a nice business / professional polo and received a collared long sleeve t-shirt,
"the material is cheap and thin, just like your old fruit of loom t-shirt",
"shirts are great, feel soft and look like they will last a long time, i ordered one size bigger and fits good, i dont like my shirts tight fitting, if your at the limit of your current size would go one size bigger,",
but over all a great shirt well worth the low cost,
got these for buy husband and they do the job,
i got him a small,
but around the arm/back area its a bit tight,
but if i had gotten him a m he would of been swimming in it,
this shirt is made well,
"it fit in the sleeves, neck, chest, and waist",
it hangs below the belt,
but not too long,
it doesn't touch the thigh,
it is a great fit and a great price,
very nice shirt,
nice material,
great color,
fits just right,
i like a more open collar,
the shirt looks nice,
but is a little too confining right at the neck,
"bought this shirt for my son who's 5'9"" 220 lbs",
he normally wears xxl and this shirt fits him perfectly,
he's autism spectrum with sensitivity issues to certain fabrics,
but said that this shirt is very comfortable to him,
so of course i'm loving this shirt,
great price too,
and bought lots more colors,
also love that the fabric is supposed to be stain resistant,
but we haven't had a chance to try that out yet,
this shirt is lightweight which is great for florida,
it's a very nice looking shirt also and my husband likes it,
the polo fits a little tighter in the belly than other brands,
it’s a “strong t-shirt” kind of material,
soft,
but stronger than a t,
the collar is just right,
color is just like it looks online,
it looks good,
def a great deal,
i bought it for myself and i'm a woman,
so the medium is pretty large,
but a good fit work makes me wear ugly clothes and the woman shirts cost way more then men's would recommend,
husband loved,
got his specific needs for work,
is long enough to not come out his pant’s band,
not super soft,
but not scratchy,
good quality,
i could've gone down a size,
it was a little wide in the shoulders for my son,
but that was my fault i didn't check his measurements before ordering,
i have a 20-inch neck and this xxx-l is tight in the neck,
but roomy in the body,
but for the price is ok,
the sizes make no sense,
every shirt i own are xl,
"i got my first order of three xl shirts and they were closer to medium,large",
so i gave the three shirts to someone in need,
i ordered,
two xxl shirts they are closer to xxxl,
makes no sense,
xl is too small and xxl is too big,
super unhappy with these shirts,
my son asked for this polo,
it was delivered quickly and it is a nice quality made shirt for the price,
it is not for warmth,
but will do for layering,
he was very happy with the purchase,
i work in a deli and with all kinds of food product and cleaning chemicals,
"i bought 3 and wear them about 40 hours a week and no signs of fading, staining, fraying or unstitching",
very soft and a little longer in length which is great for keeping it tucked in,
these shirts are top-notch stain resistant very comfortable moisture wicking nice and cool and look sharp even after washing several times they do not shrink they maintain their size and the collar keeps its shape,
i get compliments from customers all the time on how sharp i look in this shirt,
was searching on shirts and polos came across this seen price i was like very good price,
but how is the quality so decided to buy 2 of them they came to my house same day ordered i open box i was like wow good quality polo should of bought more colors recommend them don't think about it buy it,
i’m anally picky about 1,
needing a cotton-feel shirt and 2,
needing a light and cool fabric in summer shirts,
this polo is fantastic in both regards,
i tried the amazon essentials brand polo and it was ok,
but it was still the typical polo material,
a little too thick and warm for my taste,
this jerzees polo feels more like a t shirt,
nice and light and comfortable,
"looks awesome, fits perfectly, and what a price",
my husband needed a long sleeve polo for work and i didn't think much of it when he purchased this,
but they actually look great,
i love these,
"after a wasted trip to our local department store, i was pleased to find the polo shirts to complete my daughter’s uniform ensemble here on amazon",
i purchased the jerzees mens shirt for my son,
"the fit is spot on, perfect",
the quality is great,
"washes/dries well, so far no color fade",
my son stayed they are very comfortable and soft,
this is a great value for this type of shirt,
"the fabric is a bit lighter weight than some of the big name brands,",
but that is really no big deal,
i will probably order a few more in some of the other colors available,
"for the price i am very happy with the color, fabric, and feel of this shirt",
going to grab me some more next month,
i use them to work in every day i have to wear polo shirts to work everyday and they're very comfortable and warm and a great fit,
"i ordered 3 colors of these in an xl, and much to my surprise they fit like an xl, at least for me they do",
"as far as comfort goes, they are not like wearing a super soft t shirt,",
but its not a deal breaker either,
i use them when i need something a touch better than a t shirt  i would order them again,
"very nice product, what i like the best is the warmth provided during the winter months",
"ordered two of these, different colors",
shirts are nice and soft and fit well,
probably a bit thin compared to most polo shirts,
but for $10 i consider it a bargain,
"good fit, good material, nice looking shirt i can wear to work",
just as good as the $25 shirts if not better,
i spilled a drink on my shirt and when l pulled the cloth straight the liquid flew off leaving only micro dots and these did not stain,
cool,
i ordered three shirts a light blue short sleeve burgundy short sleeve and a green short sleeve,
the green one came as a long sleeve,
was a little surprised because my orders always come through correctly,
i was going to return the green one for my son,
but he  said no problem the shirts fit fine,
that is what these feel like,
i have several of them now in various colors,
great shirts,
very happy even after at least a dozen washes,
colors stay bright after repeated washings,
"however, the black one tends to slightly fade to more of a dark charecoal color after about 5 washings",
perhaps the others are fading too,
but you do not notice it as much as the black,
"i thought this was polo shirts, they turned out to be long sleeved t- shirts, not what i expected of wanted",
"i needed them for cold weather conditions, it is 39 degrees today, how can i go outside wearing one of these shirts?",
good quality polo,
buy smaller than usual size though,
even after washing several times it's shrinkage is minimal,
a 2xl fits like a 4xl,
other than that it's a great shirt,
highly recommended,
expected color to be dark brown as shown,
but came tan,
all the other shirts colors were exact ad shown,
great shirts comfy and soft,
you can't beat the price and the overall fit and appearance,
while the length of the shirt is great for tucking in,
shorts or pants,
if not tucked in the bottom fourth easily shows wrinkles once you sit down,
not a huge deal,
but it's worth knowing if you typically don't tuck in polo style shirts,
i purchased eighteen of these on a leap of faith and cannot be more pleased,
"these are about a third of the cost of the brands i have been using, and",
"while my previous brands are marginally better, for the price these are a five star value in my opinion",
these are fairly thin - about the same weight as a medium weight t-shirt -,
but are nicely made with excellent stitching and a fit that is as good as the more expensive polo shirts that they are replacing,
"if there is a single complaint, the collars do not lay as nicely as my premium shirts,",
but that is minor considering the price,
"i test fit them when i first received them, and after i was satisfied that i would not be returning them i machine washed them on cold/cold and there was no shrinkage that i could discern",
"more importantly, there was no fading",
"i will say that when i dried them the lint trap did fill quickly, so on first wash there are a lot of loose fibers",
bottom line: these are decent quality and especially for the price,
"they are almost as well made and fitting sas premium brand polo shirts, and if you are on a budget are a definite bargain",
"it came quickly, as promised, and fit well",
the color was exactly what i was looking for,
the material wasn't too heavy nor too thin,
"the shirt fits right, feels great, and the collar goes not curl",
great shirt for the price,
i needed a decent shirt to embroider my radio stations logo on it and this shirt was perfect,
it fits perfectly and is comfortable for the live activities we do on a regular basis,
excellent purchase,
i will purchase more,
just the kind of material i was looking for,
i am very pleased,
no visible shrinkage after first wash and no color bleed,
size runs very small,
"ordered a 4xl, feels like a 2xl",
"so sad, they should check the sizes before they put it on there shirts",
will not buy anything from them,
wore this shirt to universal orlando and got wet on jurassic park,
after the ride i was dry in 15 minutes,
"looked good, fit well, and only $8",
i will buy more,
the polo shirt was purchased to wear,
while working around the house,
but it could be an everyday item,
it was too large until it was washed and now it is tight,
definitely a decent shirt at a low price,
the fabric needs to be stretched to make them less long and bigger amount for us full bodied guys,
"this polo shirts are slim fit, for people with  some extra pounds, is to tight we suggest to try next size one shirt first then buy more if you like the quality which is fair for the price",
this shirt looks nice on me,
"a little long to keep on top,",
but i figured a way around that,
"i've been cautious and kept it away from the dryer, because it would certainly shrink",
no issues with it,
but it is thin,
i bought a few for my ten son for work now that’s cooler,
he has to wear a t-shirt under it though because it’s much thinner than his other work shirts,
it does shrink a bit so that’s why i bought an extra large,
it’s somewhat wrinkle free,
read the sizing chart to make sure it is the fit you want,
"my husband is tall and thin, so the large fits him just right",
but it might fit a stockier guy a bit tight,
"the material used is not very thick, so it won't keep you warm on a cold day",
"we we're disappointed by how thin it was,",
but overall it is ok for the price,
"it feels a lot of synthetic material used in it, it does not feel light and not breathing material",
"cheaply packed and cheap look to the whole thing, the sleeves end with a very tight ending very unhappy",
"good quality for the price, this shirt and it's green twin are holding shape and color",
stain resistant treatment realy works,
the slevees are a bit longer than my other polo style shirts,
but not crazy long,
no wrinkles if you hang it,
while still warm from the dryer,
this is a great shirt for a big and tall guy,
it washes so good and stays soft,
plus it didn’t shrink at all in the dryer,
my hubby loves them,
thinking about purchasing in other colors,
small holes in the sleeve,
"maybe from moths? unsure,",
but holes none the less,
other than that the shirt is nice,
i have been wearing these shirts since i started working for this company making my own uniforms,
"comfortable, moisture wicking, always gets here quickly",
it’s great and comfy,
got for my son for school and he’s a lil bigger than most kids at ten years old,
it’s nice to be able to just go to these people and get something that will not only fit my child,
but they don’t fade or shrink,
and there’s a lil play room not all snug on him,
i’m very satisfied with the quality,
i love these jerzees because they fit great and they look even better,
it is difficult to find shirts or polos in my size as am a large person,
short and muscular,
and i find that shirts that fit are too long because i have to buy either xxl or xxxl,
but these fit perfectly and the color choices are fantastic,
great price,
nice fit,
very little shirkage when washed,
holds its color,
spot guard is a plus,
wrists are a little tight,
i ordered a total of 4,
i like the length of both the bottom of the shirt and the sleeves,
"it washes well, keeps its color, and hasnt faded a bit over the last few months of wearing it to work twice a week",
i haven't even tried the shirt on,
but gotta give you credit for that old school new school clothes smell,
"being a bigger person, finding shirts that fit and look good is difficult sometimes, especially when you don't want to spend your whole paycheck on them",
"this shirt fits so well and look so good, i went and purchased several others",
"if you purchase this shirt,",
but it 1-3 sizes bigger than you normally wear,
ordered this is a last minute gift for my husband,
it is really a much nicer shirt than i expected,
"fits well, comfortable material, good color and needs no ironing",
what more could i ask?,
a shirt made for overweight people,
super big sleeves,
absolutely terrible fit for athletic / slim bodies,
i didn't really expect much from this shirt for the price,
but was very surprised how nice it is,
my husband like it and finds it very comfortable and nice looking,
"we immediately ordered another one, and i have to say the shipping was very fast",
came quicker then expected,
"this jersey didn’t fit , worst part is that i sent them straight to person to be embroidered , found about size after i paid for , now have a couple of shirts that can’t return",
"well made shirt, light weight",
but not too thin,
"spot shield stain resistant works well, water and oil beads up",
"minimal shrinkage, i’m 5’11” 225 with a belly and an xl fits nicely and stays tucked in",
"great price, great feel",
it's a roomy 50/50,
witch i like a lot - it means it will wear well and get softer with time/washes,
"solid black plain polo shirt, not a big fan of the ribbed/pipping on the end of the sleeves",
it's 50 poly and 50 cotton combo means it can last 12 years if cared for and worn three times a month,
but otherwise this is a shirt that will get softer with time and has a very rich and dark black,
my color,
shade - i like it,
a lot,
if it fades or shrinks to much i'll be back and give an update,
soft color great i should of ordered a xl instead of 2xl cause their making these shirts bigger now cause of the many men with big bellys,
an wen they dont shrink i end up giving them away,
feel like iam wearing a maternity top,
iam 68 no belly,
wanted something with a heavier weight,
this is similar to a light weight polo shirt,
bought for my hubby for christmas and he loves it,
says it fits well and is comfortable,
"haven’t washed yet, so can’t report on wrinkles, etc",
he hasn’t worn it,
"while eating yet,",
but fingers crossed it really is stain resistant,
not a real dress up shirt,
i just bought it for st paddys day,
decent for the price,
50% cotton and 50% poly,
didn't shrink on washing,
"great fabrics, fit was great other than being a long short,",
however i am a short waisted women,
"if you are on the taller side, these would be perfect",
i really like these shirts,
they are a nice medium weight and they fit my husky 13 year son old well,
they haven’t faded after washing so far,
really nice shirts @ a very fair price,
i just wanted a long-sleeve polo shirt to wear to work and elsewhere,
this meets my needs for a reasonable price,
i have a blue one and a black one,
"the collar doesn't always stay in place,",
but that's not a deal breaker for me,
i usually do not like buying clothes without first seeing them,
but i was impressed when this shirt arrived,
not only did it fit the way i had hoped,
but it was extremely comfortable,
i will no doubt do more business,
these are a great value and wash very well,
i am updating this review,
"after nearly a year of weekly wearing, i am reordering these shirts",
my husband wears them every day to work and they have held up wonderfully,
i bought this for my husband to wear to work and it's been perfect,
its light weight,
but decent quality material,
it has washed well and hasn't faded much,
after he wore it a few times he had me order him more in different colors,
definitely reccomend this item,
just an average polo,
it is hard to find a nice polo shirt with a wide range of sizes,
m-3xl,
"this was ok,",
but not awesome for the large size and my frame,
way waaaaaay too wide,
i bought these to replace a favorite of my husband's,
"since it has been many years since the original was made, i took a chance on the same brand and model description",
nope,
"these are cut very wide, more like an xl or an xxl",
"too bad, because the fabric is quite nice",
these shirts are very nice for the price,
they are a light 50/50 blend and the colors are beautiful,
not a fan of this,
was very cheap and i got what i paid for,
i bought three,
"one white, one ash and one california blue",
they are my work shirts at the golf course,
the california blue is a little bright for my taste,
"but, they all fit the way i like em'",
i will order more,
this shirt is great for the big and tall,
i know how hard it is to find clothes online when you are big and tall and this is a definite recommendation,
i'm a 5xl and it fits great and feels amazing on the skin,
with a not so tight colour,
nice fit,
color and style,
fairly well made and worth the money spent,
"shirt came with openings for 2 arms, 1 head, and a torso entry section near the bottom, as expected",
good fabric and fit,
the stain resistance is the best part,
very nice shirt husband uses these for waiting tables as an extra job,
so the price matters on a budget with today's cost of living,
i have bought over ten of these shirts and they wash up great,
i would recommend,
"got as a gift for my brother, fit as expected",
true to size,
have yet to wash it to see how it will hold up,
but the material suggests it will be just fine,
great price,
"like the 50/50 blend and the xlarge worked great for me--6""1-195",
not sure how it will come out of the wash,
but for $12 if i get 4-5 good wears out of it then it is worth it,
i liked it better than some perry ellis long sleeves i bought,
the cuffs were too small and i had to cut them off,
you're better off buying the nicer $30 polo work shirts,
i am very happy with the higher priced purchase,
the material isn't very breathable,
it was overall a waste of money,
but did its job until the higher quality shirt came,
i bought many t-shirts in the same price range,
"but this one looks poor in quality, also size is in appropriate as mentioned in the chart",
"not worth spending more than $8 for this product, i got better quality from other bands at lesser price",
i needed to get a shirt for my daughter for work since the temps dropped and it arrived quickly and fit perfectly,
item was too large and then when i exchanged it it was too small,
"super baggy, order a size down",
i wear this over two layers to comply with uniform colors,
"this shirt is this, stretchy, and not exceptional quality,",
but much better than what i feel i paid in purchase,
"a bit more of a fitted, almost unisex cut than i prefer,",
but not deal-breaking,
"sleeves are a bit short,",
"but you'll notice it in the chest and waist, as it fits almost to slim you",
not,
a bad purchase,
but may not purchase a second time,
"i love this color, i love the easy care and it looked great even though left in the dryer half a day",
my husband like his shirts,
i got him the 3xl as i was not sure how much it would shrink,
"it did shrink a little,",
but he still liked the shirt,
"i would say that if you are unsure what size to get, just buy 1 shirt at the size you normally wear, wash &amp",
dry it to see if it still fit you the right way,
that way you are only out about $10,
00's verses $100,
00's,
"perfect fit, good quality, light weight with long sleeves",
this was exactly what i was looking for and the fit was perfect,
these are made for men/women with larger chest and wings,
"quality is very good, several washings and no shrinkage to speak of, and no distortion of fit or collar",
bought this for my son and his very happy with delivery and comfort,
beautiful shirt looks great on i love my husband in polo shirts i just love my husband,
the t-shirts are very well made and they look great on,
i bought these polos for my son to wear to work at dollar tree,
they fit him perfectly and are extremely comfortable,
"they are not wrinkle free,",
"but in my opinion, that's not a deal breaker",
i ordered 2 originally and he asked me to order more,
great shirts and very quick shipping,
thank you,
the shirt fit as expected,
i like the thickness of the shirt because i wear them under a sweatshirt,
"no biggie,",
but it wasn't tagless,
great value,
purchased two for sleep and relaxing,
satisfied,
the length was shorter than my usual brand,
it was not 100% cotton and very uncomfortable to the skin,
"well made, good fabric weight, and good price",
bought two more in different colors,
i have purchased many jerzees items in the past and at that time the quality was really good,
"today the quality of the cloth is very poor, this is a shirt to use inside home",
i originally got a 2x thinking it would be a little big so i can tuck it in for work,
when it arrived i was shocked to see that it was about 3 or 4 sizes too large,
i returned it and got a 1x,
"it was still a bit larger than the  ""little big"" i expected",
but i guess it will work,
"i bought this for my boyfriend’s ron swanson halloween costume, and he loved it",
good quality and comfortable,
"he’s usually a large in shirts, and this fit perfectly",
he actually likes this so much he’s going to wear it regularly as a casual shirt,
i wanted gray and this was a true gray it's very nice shirt looks fantastic on my husband it's well-made it washes nicely and doesn't shrink,
the order was amazing fast,
"would love to given a five star rating,",
however the material at the cuff of the right sleeve was sewn leaving material sticking out,
not a deal breaker,
but it is what it is,
ordered 2 haven’t opened the second one yet,
i purchased this shirt in deep purple for my work uniform,
"it fit true to size,",
"but a little long, which i don't mind",
it's not a heavy cotton which is nice for the summer months,
the only reason i didn't give 5 stars is because the sleeves are really long,
i think it's a unisex shirt,
if i'm wrong and it's a men's shirt then the sleeve length is appropriate,
which is why i got it,
"however when i tried it on and subsequently wear it, i have to roll the sleeves up a little",
they reach my elbows,
ok shirt,
but kind of thin material,
i prefer it be a little heavier shirt,
"but does have a somewhat cheap feel to it,",
but hey it was cheap,
received in good new condition,
it fits as advertised and is a real casual wearing shirt,
it's thinner material,
but that works good for me s i dress in light layers,
good buy for the price and quality of the product,
"i liked the first ones i bought, i bought three more",
good buy on a very stylish and comfortable shirt,
fits odd,
"i can deal with it since it doesn’t look too weird as a result and it’s just for work,",
but wish i would have known since i bought 3 of them,
"ordered a large,  fits like an xl or xxl",
i would definitely recommend to at least order one size down,
other complaint was the shirt is a bit too long too,
"other than size issues,  product looks well made and on the thicker side",
had to return,
my fiance loved it and it looks incredible on him as he doesn't like tight sleeves,
but the material is rather fragile,
"needed some new polo shirts stat, and these are perfect",
"great fit, goodlooking colors, and a terrific price",
thanks a lot,
"the size fits right around the shoulders and neck,",
but the arms feel a little long,
the material is also not that breathable so it gets kind of stuffy underneath,
great fit good quality,
i need this color and style for work,
they are perfect and cheap enough,
i am a female,
but they are men’s i buy the xl and the fit good for my size which would be a xl women’s,
i have several of these shirts in different colors,
i have broad shoulders so it is hard for me to find shirts that go down my arm properly,
the sleeves on this shirt or perfect,
and for the price they just cannot be beat,
also they are stain resistant,
"nice material, typical china sizes, went up 1 size, after washing, now perfect fit",
i ordered a 2x for my husband,
great look,
"fit nice , wash’s nice, no shrinking",
over all,
would definitely purchase again,
good constructed shirt,
"i use it for work, and i like to push up my sleeves a bit",
"i have larger arms, so it was a bit snug",
"it was also a little itchy right off the bat,",
but got better with washes,
i actually really like this shirt,
i bought it for work and it's great,
the price was fantastic,
the only thing is i wish i'd gone with the medium instead of a large because it is a bit too large,
the product itself was good quality for the price,
i'm satisfied with my purchase,
will probably also buy it in the medium,
purchased for my son to wear at his job,
he wears a 5x and this seems to run a little small,
"but, soft fabric and very stain resistant",
the red is a true red color,
color was good,
but the material was ruff and shape of the shirt was off,
collar seened mishaped,
return as i could not use a ruff and misshapened shirt,
the adult ferzees fits fine,
"i weigh 206 i bought the x large ,it fits a little loose, just perfect for summer golf to keep the florida sun off my arms",
it is relatively light weigth it should be perfect for the upcoming summer season,
son needed for work,
fit perfect and seemed to be made well,
ordered 1 blue and 1 gray based on previous jerzees shirt,
these two did not disappoint,
fit is just what i expected,
material is very good fabric,
i recommend these jerzees to anyone who is looking for a nice shirt at a very reasonable price,
nice fit,
looks good,
comfortable,
long enough,
i took the white long sleeve shirt:,
"1 - the material is so cheap,",
2 - the wrist on the sleeves is so tight,
3 - if you are xl order l,
if i know it will be like this i will not spend $1 on it,
have bought several of these for work and they hold up well,
my husband is very pleased with this shirt,
"exactly what i expected, a little big because you always have to go a size up for shirts made in asia",
but comfortable and didn't shrink in the wash,
like everything except i got a medium i should have got the small,
idk if there's small i should check,
but if there isn't then i won't get it again,
i'm 5'11' 175 lbs it's pretty baggy and i'm not skin and bones,
i wanna show myself,
oh well,
this shirt is nice looking and very comfortable,
i generally wear it alone on cool days,
but may wear it under a sweater or sweatshirt if the temperature is cooler,
i plan to buy additional shirts in different colors,
a little big for my husband,
but it works,
these shirts are so perfect for my husband,
it is part of his work uniform,
i bought some for him in november and ordered more,
i ordered black for work and got navy,
ordered a small cuz i ordered a medium shirt on here before so i thought it’d fit better,
nope,
it was huge,
i needed a more fitted shirt for work,
will be returning and won’t be buying again :,
"i needed a green polo styles shirt for work and for that, it works",
i found the shirt to be very comfortable,
i will be getting more of them,
my husband is a big fan of these - they are soft &amp,
not too heavy- he doesn’t sweat when wearing these &amp,
he can comfortably layer them with his sweaters,
great products and super fast shipping,
"comfortable long sleeve pullover shirt, bought 1 red and 1 green",
like them both very much,
"the price is great,",
"but the shirt is thin and a bit stif, which might improve after a wash",
i also ordered the amazon basics regular polo to compare and i found the amazon basics polo to be slightly more substantial and a bit more comfortable for just a few dollars more,
"the jerzees shirt is decent for the price,",
but ultimately i returned the jerzees shirt and kept the amazon basics,
can't rate this item as i did not get the correct style or size in 3 tries,
"bought it for a work shirt, works fine",
far better than i expected for the price if i'm honest,
bought a couple other shirts from them as well since this one was good,
shirt fits well if you normally wear a large you should get a large,
i love this shirt so much i bought two,
i wear it under my work shirts and sometimes to sleep,
comfy and not too thick,
"good shirts,quality's good, sustains wear and tear,still holding up",
it's just thin material which i suppose is good for summer heat,
the collar needs good ironing to make it not too floppy,
"but it does what it is supposed to, clothe me",
"excellent fit, comfort, and washes and dries beautifully",
very good quality for a reasonable price - highly recommend,
arrived quickly and in perfect condition,
comfortable fit,
"has not been washed yet,",
but i don't anticipate any problems,
good value for this shirt,
shirt is of good quality,
the fabric is not quite as comfortable as more expensive fabrics,
but is ok,
eexcellent,
love it,
fast shipping,
"great product, exactly what is was hoping for",
"i'm 5'7"", about 150 lbs, and ordered a m that fits just fine",
"a little big,",
but not too much,
bought it for work,
"i guess not bad for the price,",
but i was sent a medium instead so i could not review the fit,
"otherwise, i liked the more expensive better quality shirt i ordered along with this item",
i tried two polo's and two shirts,
a little large across the shoulder,
not a big issue,
may try a medium next time,
perfect,
"for the price, these are get fitting polo shirts",
this was a great buy for the money,
i’m 6’3” and it fits very well,
i line dry them as i’m sure the dryer would shorten their life,
now have three of these shirts and would buy them again,
living and working in central florida these are my go to shirts,
"they’re good for most casual occasions, cool and comfortable",
at 6-4 and 190lbs size large fits well,
long enough for tails in or out,
i’ve gotten several in different colors and the size and quality are consistent,
i’ve paid  much more for lesser shirts elsewhere,
shirt is too tight for a 2xl,
"i have xl's that fit better, and sleeves are  very tight also, particularly at the cuff",
i didn't order 2xl because i'm toned &amp,
"lean, c'mon folks sell them to fit",
comfortable,
but really long,
the xl fits my chest/shoulders,
5'10 200lbs,
but the length is equivalent for someone well over 6 feet,
xactly what i needed - an inexpensive collared shirt,
"basically, its a t-shirt",
a nice one,
with a collar,
at a very affordable price,
the color is very nice too,
i also bought a similar hanes collared shirt and i am posting the same review on those too,
very happy,
i bought this as a test sample for a future bulk order to have embroidered with our company logo,
the fit was accurate and did not shrink in the laundry,
this is a quality shirt and the price can't be beat,
i'll be ordering about 200 of these shortly for our employees,
began to pill after first washing,
after a couple more washings it shrunk some,
i can still wear it under a jersey or sweater so i will keep it,
too much hassle to return,
these shirts are a really great value,
"the sizing is pretty accurate,",
but the shirts are definitely on the long side and are meant to be worn tucked in,
"when tucked in, i think they look pretty good",
"the material feels a bit odd initially and it doesn't absorb sweat at all, so don't expect these to feel or behave the way cotton shirts do",
"also, the workmanship on the sleeves and collar are somewhat cheaply done,",
but it is to be expected on shirts at this price,
unbelievable high quality shirt for the price,
"they're nice enough to wear with dress slacks for business casual, and light enough in the summer heat",
i've gotten the same shirt in multiple colors,
i just wish they'd get the granite blue one in stock,
"it came unwrap, like it was used",
i bought one and immediately bought a second one,
they are great for casual office wear,
"not too thin, and they fit well with bright colors",
they collar is slight limp,
but that is manageable,
will purchase again in a third color,
needed a collared shirt for work and found this product for a low price,
"it fit perfect, was comfortable and was appropriate for the workplace",
it's softer than i thought it'd be,
bright red,
very nice,
"i like the way they fit, and i also like the price",
perfect for work,
"lightweight, true to size, great color green",
looks great on my fiancé,
the color is a nice forest green,
only thing is when you dry it you need to pull it right out of the dryer because it is not wrinkle free,
holds up great in the wash and color is still vibrant,
i'm happy with my purchase,
good price and good fit,
this is a good quality casual polo and the price was very good,
nice looking polo shirt,
"very nice shirt, well made and fits perfectly",
i'd definitely buy it again,
"these shirts are made from the most stiff, scratchy, non flexible thin fabric i have ever felt",
so uncomfortable,
very cheap,
"i wear extra large to be comfortable,",
"but even before washing, this shirt was too small and tight",
"material seemed ok,",
but watch sizing,
nice color and style,
but is not what the description says,
washed many times,
no fade or shrinkage,
warm in cool temps,
arrived stained,
granddaughter washed it and the stains came out,
but not happy that it was stained on arrival,
a great shirt for the price,
easy wash and dry,
fits great and looks fine,
after 10 washings and still looks good,
i feel a great value,
this was a gift for my husband,
he needed long sleeve tees &amp,
polos,
it fit as we thought it might,
it looks good on him,
light weight,
"but seem okay,fits good",
love these shirts,
i have them in several different colors and they all fit great,
great value as well,
good inexpensive shirt for crafting,
material is a bit thinner and polyester than i would have liked,
durable,
but not a soft cotton,
but the rest of the shirt was roomy,
affordable,
i'd consider it in the future,
nice shirts can’t beat them for the money,
held up as expected for $10,
would buy again,
product was not true black,
also very thin material,
white color can be seen straight through,
will not purchase again,
"color is great,  fit is exactly as expected",
"collar started curling up almost immediately which is a pet peeve,",
but fir the price it is a nice shirt,
this fit perfect for my needs,
came quick,
less wrinkles,
hard to measure yourself out when buying clothes online,
"buuuuut, that being said, this is a great alternative shirt to wear when the company you work for doesn’t allow your tattoos to show",
nice looking shirt,
fits well and isn't small like most shirts i seem to be getting when i order on-line,
for a basic polo everyday run to the grocery store this are fine,
but definitely not a shirt i would wear when going out for a public event or night out,
could have bought a better product for $5-6 more,
luv the fit,
light weight great for summer,
will buy again,
very comfortable,
great quality for the price,
nice lightweight material,
a little on the large and long side,
"chest is 48"" and length is 31",
"25""",
"xl is typically 46-48"" chest and 30"" length",
a large in this brand was equal to an xl in every other brand i’ve tried,
the material is a little corse,
fits as expected and is made of good quality material,
it really does repel liquid as i have spilled tea on myself a few times,
i swear the tea companies are out to get me with their overly full bottles,
i like the burgundy color and it makes a great work shirt,
seems to wash and dry well too,
well fitting,
they are very comfortable and look nice,
"i'm usually hesitant to buy clothes online due to the hassle of returning them if they don't fit,",
but these fit perfectly and are comfortable as well,
love them,
very comfortable,
not true to size runs big,
for the price it's great,
cloth is a little thin a s cheap,
i got xl and i am 260lb 5 ft 7 man so fairly large,
"great comfy shirt, no side seams either",
super soft,
i only wear polo shirts or dress shirts,
never a tee shirt,
these types of shirts wear well and fit well,
just air dry them after washing,
they last,
no wearing from cleaning it,
shirt was as expected,
"not a fan of hemmed sleeves,",
but they are large enough it's not tight on the arms,
very happy with the purchase,
"can't speak to moisture wicking and wrinkle resistance yet, though",
early days,
i really like the color and the weight of the material - my only beef is that the sleeves are way too long,
they're nearly at my elbows,
comfortable with a good fit,
nice long sleeve polo,
"much better quality than i expected, i was surprisingly pleased and so was my husband",
it's worth it,
great lightweight shirt for the humid weather we have down south,
well made and durable,
nice shirt for outside work or play,
not something you would wear to an office,
"well made, and very comfortable",
you get what you pay for,
"after one wash, consider it just another cloth to wipe and clean up your dog’s piss, clean a spill, or just to wipe your ass with",
"fit was smaller than expected,",
"but with these cheap companies, quality isn’t their strong-suit",
"great shirt, washes well and leaves no wrinkles - bonus",
our son works at target and they are a great find,
"great product, excellent service and would buy from again",
almost too big,
"retains heat super well, makes me sweat at work",
do not reccommend,
great shirts,
bought several different colors,
great fit,
great price,
great shirt that fits the way a shirt should,
"my husband needed these for work so i ordered him two, he says they are comfortable and breathable",
i find them easy to clean and they fit well even after washing,
"they arrived a lot sooner than the expected delivery date, which i always appreciate",
these are good quality shirts and i would recommend them,
"these run a bit small, and i found them to be thin",
order one size up for summer and you should be happy,
the shirt fits well and feels nice,
however it is very thin,
"given it's white, you can pretty much see through it",
"nice work polo,nice fit as well",
seems like good quality,
my boyfriend loves this shirt even though he’s normally a xl guy shirts end up shrinking up on him so we went a size bigger and after washing and drying this shirt it was a perfect,
still a little wide,
but the right length,
to light weight for my liking,
i was looking for a thick work shirt,
i'm a large in women got few of these on medium they fits perfectly,
choose the men sizes since its way cheaper then women sizes us or a polo anywho,
got 3 of these for my sons work,
size l,
he is 6’1” about 190,
it’s loose,
but not too big,
great for work,
they have washed up nicely,
weekly washing for 4 months now and still going strong,
"i’d say great for the price, good well wearing material, true to size",
fits well,
size appropriate,
", washes well",
"no shrinking, no pills",
", and so far it's holding up very well",
great shirt for the price,
"doesn't have that thick expensive feel,",
but it works for me,
"i wear this type of shirt frequently for work, and sometimes get them stained, so i go through about 4 or more a year",
saved me a some cash,
arrived early,
nice looking shirts,
"they are going to be work shirts, and they are perfect for that purpose",
"very light material, for summer wear",
the white was like a “see-thru thin”,
also,
customer service was amazing,
couldn’t ask for more,
great shirt,
"blue color was extremely faded,",
but it will do,
i bought several of these for my grandson for school,
these shirts have a velvety feel to them and are not cheaply made,
i am impressed,
they are easy-care and fit with enough room to be comfortable,
he has a husky build,
"the sleeves come down past his wrist just enough to cover them unlike some ""long-sleeved"" polos",
"they are, in my opinion, bright white and look very nice on him",
"i had searched the internet for other long-sleeve, white polos and did some math and these came out as the best buy for volume",
i think it was an excellent buy,
"the packaging was secure, delivery fast, and price was great for budget-minded purchasing",
great price for two ugly blue shirts,
i don’t hate the shirts just the color,
very nice,
great fit,
not as  breathable or “wicking” as i hoped for,
"just as others have written, this polo is more like tshirt material",
but it fits great and is comfortable,
the collar has held up nicely after several washes,
if you remove it from the dryer immediatel there are not many wrinkles,
i got this for my husband and it's lightweight for the summer,
he needs to wear long sleeves at all times and this really fits the bill,
overall good shirt,
use as undershirt,
"new, fits well",
product arrives a day later than promised,
horrible shirts,
wrinkled to the point you can't even iron them out,
"luckily, they're cheap and perfect for getting bleach all over them",
"great fit, decent fabric quality, and it didn't seem to bleed in the wash, which",
given the color,
is fantastic,
hubby pleased,
"with amazon, my mom can shop for me just as if she were at a store",
but she can't go to a store so this allows her to buy gifts for me and others that she wouldn't otherwise be able to buy,
this was another success story,
it looks good right out of the dryer and is soft and comfortable to wear,
we live in a high desert area and this material is to be comfortable year round,
i've had it for a,
while now and it 's been washed many times,
but it has never pilled up which not only looks bad,
but is really uncomfortable as well,
"thanks amazon for making it easy for my mom to shop for me and this way she can leave an item in my cart and if i don't remove it, she knows i like it",
it's a foolproof way of giving,
there's not an element of surprise,
but also no element of shock - the gift never turns out badly this way and there are usually eviews from other customers that one can look through to aid in making a final decision,
"amazon is definitely the best way to shop for our family and this shirt was a good gift that hasn't faded, still has the same color as when i first got it and as an aside, the collar on this shirt doesn't roll like some of the brands of polo shirts i've owned in the past",
as advertised,
this is a nice basic uniform shirt,
i wish i had bought more when it was just $10,
good quality with the price,
i have not noticed much wrinkle,
with this price i am satisfied with the product,
"i like the comfort of the shirt, very good",
"i recommend anyone needs a long sleeve polo, this is it",
"ordered for christmas pictures for husband, it looked nice to match our son",
basically a thin white long sleeve t-shirt with a collar,
"i was expecting the nice thick polo shirt material, whatever it's called",
you get what you pay for,
"simple polo shirt, good for most any casual event or work if you are in a call-center type place",
"they could have a little more ""shape"" to them,",
but are fine for what they are,
i have bought this same shirt in several different colors,
the colors don't seem to be fading as fast as some other brands,
"i would buy again, for sure",
and not listed,
"so far, so good",
it fit,
"based on reviews, i didn't dry it, i placed it on the rack to dry",
color didn't run on other clothes,
"i will say, it's thinner material than i thought,",
but still does the job,
"huband says it's comfy, and roomy",
garbage quality material collected lint in the dryer like it was its job,
as you can see from the photos it looks horrible,
bought these for my husband,
great quality and have help up really well after numerous washings,
"i haven't found any notable shrinkage issues, and the color has stayed true",
"was looking for a nice polo-type shirt without having to spend a bundle, since this would be used for work and i am very pleased with this purchase",
thin &amp,
cheap material,
it’s also see through too,
the shirt is good,
"but wish it was a little smaller because after repeated washing, zero shrinkage",
medium size is smaller than expected,
thin material,
prob only good to wear under a sweater like a t-shirt,
ordered green for a new job,
i was happy with the price,
"it is smell resistant, and i have not stained it yet,",
but it seems like a normal shirt pretty much,
"i wouldn't put too much faith in the stain resistance, since when i spill water on it, it acts like normal fabric",
"since i am a bigger woman, i often order men's, and this fit as expected for my approximation, and did work even considering my chest",
would recommend,
love my amazon prime and wouldn't know what to do with amazon,
i buy these shirts for my son because he has to wear specific school colors and collared shirts,
perfect,
"they are good quality, fit as expected, tablets and great color options",
i have no complaints and my son is happy,
this is a decent shirt it’s not the thickest,
but it’s decent,
something i can wear to work and care easily,
"fits well, cost is reasonable",
"bright color, good fit",
"i got this shirt for work,  and its super comfortable",
i liked the shirt,
husband likes the shirt,
"fits well, comfortable",
ordered these for my father as he has a bad habit of staining up his shirts,
they size ran as expected and liquids bead right off of these shirts,
looks great and feels comfortable,
"this shade of blue is quite dark,",
but looks good,
"this appears to be a very well made shirt, enough to order two more in additional colors",
good quality and attractive shirt especially for the price,
"though, i wish the sleeves were a couple of inches shorter and not touching my elbows",
had to return the product since it did not fit well,
also has to chase seller to get refund after returning the product,
well worth the $11,
74,
washes terribly,
"after one washing, this shirt is all pulled",
purchased to promote a statement against cancer,
"wears well, color and durability has been great thus far",
makes for a great work shirt,
comfy and fits like i wanted,
only problem is that it attracts hair and whatnot easily,
but that's fixable with a lint roller,
i bought short sleeve shirts at target,
but could only find long sleeve shirts here,
the fabric is thinner and not as good quality as the shirts i found at target,
i like these shirts,
but two of them within a few months developed holes in the armpit areas,
i was able to sew them,
but two out five in just a few months seems to indicate a possible production problem,
nice shirt,
i gave it to my husband for his birthday and he liked it,
i ordered xl and it was a good fit,
i liked the shirt i ordered so much that i ordered 5 more,
i have fancier and more expensive shirts of this type and these are the perfect ones for everyday use,
nice price for school uniform,
quality and color is great,
but the size runs really big,
make sure to check sizing before you order,
nice fit and comfortable,
great shirt for the price,
i was hoping for a heavier material for winter use,
but it will do,
great,
great quality,
i liked the first one so much i ordered 3 more in various colors,
for the price it’s good,
"but it’s got no shape, no taper at all so just hangs off your body",
good deal 🇺🇸,
"the shirt is well made, color very vibrant and the material is soft",
it fits as expected,
i highly recommend this shirt due to great price and quality,
my boyfriend wears a 4x,
but i got a 5xl in case of shrinkage,
way too small more like a 3xl,
horrible quality very very low quality on the fabric,
this shirt fits a tiny bit tighter than i would have liked,
compared to say,
haynes brand,
but it was inexpensive and it washes okay too,
"by this, i mean that the shirt maintains its color and texture well even after several washes and dries",
"also, it's not super soft",
it's soft and comfy,
but not super soft,
it's a shirt,
very nice cotton blend,
fits great and looks good coming out of the laundry,
almost all i wear during the colder weather months,
well worth the low price,
"you get what you pay for, an inexpensive collared short sleeve shirt",
"great for work,",
but the color is not as rich as the picture,
"i got it to dress up my causual clothes a little,",
but it looks as cheap as it costs,
thanks,
great,
"fits just right, i'm 5'7 130lbs and small is just right",
the sleeves are a bit longer than my other shirts,
but everything's fine,
my dad loves the material,
my dad liked his gift,
material is soft and good quality,
looks good,
i would buy more,
like,
super thin shirts not a fan of thin shirts almost feels like just a cloth,
fit is ok,
but the material is pretty flimsy,
i would not buy again,
light weight and comfortable,
don’t care for the feel of these,
thought it might get better with a wash,
but feel the same,
have not washed the shirt,
but it appears to be of good quality,
good fit and value for the money,
just dont dry them,
"not only did this jersey fit well, it looks nice",
expect to get compliments when you wear it,
"i'm 5'11"", 180#, a size somewhere between medium and large",
"i usually find, large fits loose and feels a bit too relaxed, medium is sometimes a bit tight, and the long sleeves aren't that long",
"however, this jersey still fits good, even after a few washes",
"the collar has a good firmness and set to it, which i believe gives it its neat appearance",
"the sleeves have good length, with firm fitting cuffs, maybe slightly smaller",
"but not tight on my arms, which makes it perfect as a base, under shirt",
weather is getting cooler,
"the body length is long and fits snugly, well below my waist",
"not too bulky, that it can be tucked in and stays in",
"i believe i'll be getting a few more, perhaps with a pocket",
nice shirt a little thin,
but ok,
very comfortable and fits well to my slender form,
"the sleeves are a bit long,",
but i like them that way,
i can lean back with my hands behind my head and you will not see any armpit hair,
the color is true to the image and looks very professional,
exactly what i needed,
material is a kind of light,
but i will buy more in a different color,
good shirt and price,
"these shirts are a nice fit,",
but lighter than i would have expected long sleeve golf shirts to be,
"inexpensive, so for the price",
the quality was what i expected,
"pretty sheer, definite need an undershirt in white",
looks as pictured,
"nice thick material, good quality",
shirt fit well,
can be tucked in if needed,
but wears better untucked,
a little thinner than hoped for,
but overall decent shirt so far,
shirt fits good it's just the material is a little plastic like if you understand what i'm talking about i can tell it want hold up being dry cleaned too many times without fading,
but overall decent for a little,
while i think,
"fits well, looks good, color holds up with washing",
good value,
material seems to be thinner than expected,
but the price was low so,
"shipped quickly, appears to be very good quality, fabric weight seem right, stitching seem good, haven't worn it yet, hope it holds up",
great shirt i will buy more colors,
ordered several of these for work,
6 months of wear and washing and these shirts still look great,
great quality and fit,
i'm a female and bought this shirt to cut it into a crop top,
"i'm 5'5"" 117 pounds and a small fits me perfect, no bagginess, maybe even a little tight",
"the green color bleeds in the wash, only washed it once though so not sure if it won't bleed anymore after the first wash",
but it didn't lose its color,
a nice basic shirt,
not distinctive,
but a solid everyday basic shirt at a good price,
the large was very small,
i tried to return the shirt,
but the vendor wanted to charge me a restocking fee,
i gave the shirt to goodwill with a note that it is very small for a large size,
"a great value,",
but with some shortcomings,
the polo fabric is rough,
the polo is well made for the price,
nice &amp,
comfy with good bright colors,
comfortable and stylish,
oh i just love it,
good,
decent shirt,
kinda see through,
but he wore an undershirt and that fixed it,
sleeves were tight,
but my husband has large arms,
over all a good shirt just not a big and tall friend fit,
love it,
the quality of the shirt was not what i was expecting,
the collar felt as if it wouldn't hold it's shape either,
i will be returning the item,
got this to match my dark concord 11s and they did the trick,
like a thik t shirt material,
it is fine,
fit was a shade smaller than i would like,
"i, initially, bought one shirt to check the fit and quality of the shirt",
i was surprised by how nice the shirt actually is,
"so, i ended up ordering two more",
you won't find a better polo for the money,
"i promise you, no b",
very poor quality,
if i use same amount for other brand will better,
from this product amazon better i will choose,
other brand,
nice shirt fits well,
ordered xl and it fit more like a 2x,
the fit and feel of this shirt is perfect,
"i have a very picky husband, and he loves this shirt",
"didn't notice any shrinkage, either",
will buy more when needed,
"i needed a shirt for work, since i always use t-shirts i decided to switch it up",
this polo shirt fits fantastic,
"i’m a big guy,",
but this shirt had it all,
comfy material,
light,
but strong,
", loose fit",
"but not baggy, great length",
i plan on buying a few more,
the price is right and it is basically a wrinkle free garment,
the material is one i would not pick out on my own or would buy again,
not smooth or silky,
maybe just a personal preference,
fit and quality as expected,
bought for my boyfriend and it for perfect,
great fit and great quality,
very comfortable,
did not shrink after washing and drying,
wanted a nice fitting comfortable knock around polo,
this one is perfect,
great product at a great price,
required for work and have to wear it over thermal shirt and a turtleneck,
i work in the freezer,
but uniform required,
so cheap hardly worth my time to write this,
garbage material and construction,
my husband loves it,
no complaints from him,
the fabric feels very cheap,
it doesn't feel like the t-shirts of the same fabric weight,
the stitching on the red one i purchased was a little crooked in parts,
i plan on wearing them when i don't care if it gets ruined,
fit was far larger than expected and the material is very thin and nearly see through,
love it,
dishonest sale,
advertised as tagless and both the red and blue polos came with tags,
very upset,
"buying clothing on-line, is like a box of chocolates",
you never know what your going to get,
"as for this product, the material is a little thin",
"and like most men's shirts, the sleeves are too long",
"i mean, why do they always go like 2 inches past your hands? there must be a lot of really long armed people out there",
"the fit, feel, and look is better than expected for the price",
will buy again,
see above,
"well fit comfortable really love it looks good working dollar tree , wore it st paddys day people really complemented its color",
nice material good fit and good price for the size,
would definitely buy again,
bought as gift,
great shirt,
changing my first review,
very tight fit after first wash,
material quality degraded,
:-,
i was using my cell to shop amazon,
so very small screen,
"the photo looked like the shirts had a white trim, turns out it was a drop shadow",
the shirts are just one color,
thin material,
"i love the color of the shirt,and it is very warm to wear and comfortable",
i needed some maroon shirts to have lettered and embroidered for my school,
"i couldn't buy locally nor from ll bean, my #1 go-to place as they didn't have them",
i found these and they work perfectly,
"purchased as a work shirt,",
but wound up using it for a dress shirt with slacks,
received compliments on the appearance a couple of times,
this shirt fit my husband awesomely,
it washes beautifully and he loved the comfort,
great value,
fit good,
best for late fall into winter because they are heavy weight material😀,
not quality not comfortable  ugly sloppy looking,
fits just right  and feels great,
excellent shirt,
very comfortable to wear,
great value for the money,
i plan on getting more,
for the price this is a good value,
"pretty nice, cheap, shirt",
sleeves are a tad long,
good for the price looks ok as photo fast delivery,
my new husband wore this for our wedding,
it is very attractive and well made,
the color was stunning for a casual wedding,
for the price the product is very good quality,
p hunt,
"great fit, looks good",
perfect fit,
material is perfect,
great fit,
sized right,
"comfortable, fits well, size is as described",
"doesnt fit in the waist area,to snug",
fits in the shoulders great,
i bought this for my brother,
it fit perfectly,
and i love the color,
"they are a little thin, that was expected for the price",
order a size larger then you are as they run very narrow in the body,
nice shirt,
thin material so will probably need an undershirt,
purchased a large in forest green for my husband along with two others,
these seem true to size and are soft and roomy,
he would not wear this to golf in,
but it's a great weekend shirt with jeans,
he likes it so for the price i will order more,
they look very nice on,
"i have to black where i work, it is perfect, i go through a lot of them",
"cheap, thin shirt,",
but does it’s job,
thankfully i bought it to use for a halloween costume,
comfortable,
quedo muy bien,
my friend was so pleased with the fit and comfort of this shirt,
i ordered a small and a medium,
they arrived together in a wad,
"the shirts had no tags, and were slightly soiled",
it looked like someone had thrown their dirty laundry in a bag and shipped it to me,
the material was woven very loosely and was slightly see-through,
i wouldn't even keep them for rags,
"great fit, washes just fine and the material is ideal for the houston heat",
will bee ordering more shortly,
"nice breathable material , kind of short length wise",
"but size width wise was great , it fit nice for our pink/ white family photos and looked great",
i brought these for my son for back to school,
my own fault for ordering them a little big,
but they look good,
perfect for spring / fall,
great fit,
"highly recommend,",
comfortable,
good color,
comes in a variety of colors,
shipped quickly,
i'm very satisfied with this purchase,
i ordered a few other colors,
perfect work shirts,
i am very please with my jerzees shirts,
i bought two and and they are better than i expected for roughly $10 each,
they run a little big,
"very typical cheap uniform type of shirt,",
but that's what i knew and ordered,
fits the bill for a long sleeved polo just to wear around,
average fit for an average body,
seems to be holding up well to daily restaurant work,
bought as a gift,
this shirt looked like it had been worn already,
it had some kind of animal fur on it :/,
"really nice, quality shirts",
you won't be disappointed,
"lightweight, easy and breezy polo shirt",
very comfortable in summer weather,
"size is perfect until you wash them- shrink up in length, not body",
this is not 100% cotton so they should not shrink,
i bought 4 and am not happy,
i bought them to work and so far so good after  the first week,
fits well confortable,
the shirt i got was little bit to big,
so i’m washing it now i’m bit it in the dryer see what happens after that,
but other then that no problem with the shirts no no rips or tears in the shirt,
came really fast,
the shirt seemed to pull in the sleeves in which is odd to me,
my father is a med normally,
but has broad shoulders,
this shirt in large fit perfectly,
he loves it,
wearing well washing well color still red getting compliments,
great buy,
wears well,
fits good,
it's a good quality polo for the price and fits as expected,
nice shirt,
my son is very picky,
but he loves it as a school uniform shirt,
nice texture and the spot/stain guard is great,
looks nicer than a plain cotton polo,
this product is priced correctly,
you get your money's worth,
"nothing more, nothing less",
works fine for my workouts,
good value for the money,
awesome,
good quality and fit as expected,
the best part was the price,
i will recommend this seller,
these are perfect,
he says they are comfortable and not too heavy,
it fit perfect,
i have always preferred mens shirts more than womens as they always fit right,
i am short and have short arms and the sleeves are really long,
but i can just roll them up,
"good product, good price",
i like the color and how it fits,
"don't expect a nice heavy gauge thread count, for this pique polo",
"but, for the money it fits and will work just fine",
my fault,
estimated size xxl was right for me,
"but perhaps i have lost some of my ""girth"" will order xl later",
otherwise great all round,
great deal,
"thought men shirts rab alittle largee,the small fits me just right,medium is better",
i deducted one star because i was under the impression this was more of a golf light weight polo,
however this feels like a 100% cotton shirt,
but for the price i think it's a good deal,
the colors aren't as vibrant as a polyester golf shirt would be,
i'm wondering if it will fade with a few washes,
looks good,
doesn't have a faded look,
very clean and perfect fit,
i bought this for work beings it was getting cold,
"they are great, and fits just right",
wrinkles did not come out after washing--will not order again,
i’d like to return it,
"working a warehouse, it is nice and breathable",
good shirt,
sleeves are a bit too long for a short sleeve,
ok for the price,
my hubs loves these so i was very surprised given the inexpensive price,
they fit great,
"we got these shirts for our 2 older boys, because they needed for work",
came in kinda thin material washed it once shrunk two sixes had to toss it,
to long,
fits as expected not over sized,
material light weight,
"love the color, comfortable, washes great",
love how nice it looks on my hubby,
"dispersa muy bien humedad, se oye ya arrugas con las horas pero en general me quedo muy bien y me gusto mucho",
comfortable and warm,
this is a well made shirt,
"be aware that is it not just purple, it's purple",
this is not a bad thing if you like that color as i do,
i've purchased shirts from this company before and they are light and perfect in the deep southern state i live in,
"i highly recommend these shirts and the seller, jerzees",
i think i'll go get another,
more like t-shirt material,
made for wearing tucked not outside the pants,
great for a cool day on the golf course or a pajama top if you get caught in a blizzard in denver,
"comfortable, easy-care",
i wear these every day,
my dad liked his shirt,
size is great and nice,
thought it would be a little bit heavier,
thicker material,
it’s a light nice shirt,
thank you,
to play golf in,
with all the heat i wanted a thin shirt that breathes and this shirt does,
i like black because it is formal,
this shirt is right for me in the winter here and washable,
it’s a good polo,
looks cheap though so won’t wear much or just around the house,
it doesn't breathe as much as my son was hoping for,
but it is half polyester like most polos are,
like it all kinds,
"feels good, good color and goes with plenty",
for me it's a comfortable shirt,
it's not a light nor is it a heavy shirt,
but kind of in the middle,
i really like it,
so far i've washed it once and it's still good,
me enviaron otro productos que no eran,
decegcionado,
luego pedí otra camisa de otro size me enviaron 3sueras pequeñas los tube q botar no tengo tiempo de printiar y devolverlo soy muy ocupado me gusta que me den mis productos correcto x eso pago mi dinero vale mucho,
gracias,
it was too big for me so i gave it my brother,
he liked the material and fit,
perfect fit,
"great shirts, very comfortable, wash perfect",
have 3,
nice shirt,
but i put a las vegas raiders patch on it to vastly improve it visual appeal,
i like the shirt and made me comfy to wear it at work and the color is very nice love it,
like the fit a d feel,
does not hold wrinkles,
i bought these for my husband,
he loves it,
very comfy and does well in the wash,
i bought 3 more,
i bought this for my husband for a birthday party and it was nice on him,
he is a big guy with a decent gut on him and this shirt looked good,
"it wasn't sort or tight, he liked the material",
my husband loves these tops,
have already bought him 4 of them,
husband loves it,
nice material and great fit,
quality matches the price,
i bought a ralph lauren at the same time,
this one has good quality and size is correct,
you can feel the difference in materials,
good value,
"the company i work for bought presents for a family in need, i only went on what size they had on the list so not sure how it fits,",
but the shirt looked nice and of good quality,
this fabric is light yet not clingy,
it is a comfortable fit &amp,
is easy to clean,
dried,
quickly,
i ordered these for my husband before we went on vacation,
they travel well and do not wrinkle,
the purple shade is pretty,
however quality is poor,
collar rolled and hem unraveled after first washing,
also size runs small,
i will be returning,
i really liked the value and condition the shirt was delivered in,
i got these shirts because it is getting colder here and we have to wear these kind of shirts to work,
they work for what i bought them for,
but they are not as warm as i thought that they were going to be,
i will be buying something different that is thicker and warmer,
but other than that it is what i expected it to be,
"great shirt for the price, will order more",
"my son loves this work shirt, looking forward to wearing to work during the winter months",
package received early 3 day before expected due date,
i like this shirt fits comfortably,
recommended,
material is very thin and light weight,
sleeve area is a little longer than most short sleeve shirts,
they look great,
made a little on the slim side,
but that works for my skinny boys,
i like the fit the length and the color,
the quality for the price is amazing for last minute uniform,
the hand feel and fit was great,
shirt is made well and fits as expected,
long enough to cover belly over-hang,
bought 5 more,
great under jumpers,
better than ladies,
nice shirt except for the sleeves,
they have some sort of elastic in them and they cling to your arms and make it a little bit uncomfortable to wear,
these shirts are very comfortable and after a quick ironing job appear very business casual,
"i like these a lot and will purchase more, especially now that it's starting to get cold",
"brace yourselves, winter's coming 😑",
i love these shirts,
keep 'em comin,
"thanks,again, and stay safe",
"overall, a very good shirt for the price, especially for work or school purposes",
i didn't have any issues with the size,
it was loose as expected and not clingy,
the material is slightly thinner than expected,
but is not at all a serious issue,
nice product,
well made,
great price,
"it fits as expected, relaxed fit not slim fit",
the back is long enough to cover your backside,
the top of your pants,
when you bend over,
it held up well to washing and drying on warm with jeans,
lighter than polo,
but good build quality and a much valued shirt,
purple color is nice,
good medium quality for price,
haven't washed it yet,
but seems to fit a little larger than size stated,
"nice shirt, fits loose",
anyone who wrote a negative review is acting like they paid $50 for it haha,
$8,
"quality well worth it, looks casual or professional",
can't go wrong,
good fit and value for the money,
"good fit, nice shirts, will definitely recommend and buy again",
"im 5'10"", this shirt untucked is like a skirt",
pretty good for the price for the black polo,
the white polo is super thin and very see through,
great value,
my husband needed them for work,
they fit well and they're comfortable,
just wish they were a bit thicker,
they're kind of like a long sleeve tshirt,
but otherwise a good buy for the cost,
very nice for the money,
"however, it shrinks a little when washed",
may want to order a size larger,
"overall the shirt fit well in the body and shoulders, it was slightly tight in the forearms and maybe an inch to short due to my big belly",
those are not the fault of the shirt,
but just the way i'm built,
i ordered 6 more of these shirts in the xxl size,
muscular/lean,
the fabric is of good quality,
i bought these online since i couldn’t find the colors i ordered in person,
when they arrived they looked great,
"unfortunately, that was the last time they looked great",
wash them once and they become rags,
i do not reccomend,
"nice shirt,",
however it runs on the larger side,
husband loves it,
he wants me to buy more in different colors,
the husband got two of these for christmas and wears them frequently,
"when asked whether he liked them, he said, ""they're good",
""" and they're affordable, so i think they're good, too",
"it feels like t-shirt material, so it is light and airy, yet doesn't look like a t-shirt",
i wear it to important meetings and nobody questions it,
the shirt is short sleeve,
but is what i would call too heavy for summer,
i definitely would not wear on a hot humid day,
it also runs small,
great fit,
keeps me warm when i go out,
thin cheap material,
would not recommend at all,
i love these shirts,
i use them for work shirts,
i can wear them on a job and still look nice enough to go into places and still look nice,
excellent quality for the price,
nice and warm,
very soft fabric and perfect for layering,
3 stars simply because i think the price is appropriate for the quality,
otherwise it’s a 1 star all day,
"terrible material for a polo, color has no rigidity at all, sleeves are bunchy, spend 10 more dollars and get yourself a decent shirt",
nothing about this looks or feels professional,
"more like a cheap long sleeve for working out or something,",
but it just happens to have a color,
fast ship,
perfect fit,
"wow, these are really nice shirts for the price",
the feel substantial,
the collars on them are nicer than on some polos i've spent 2-3 times as much on,
and they washed nicely,
i would definitely recommend,
and i will be buying more of them,
"great shirt, great price",
these shirts work well for work and have held up so far,
the spot shield thing works if its like a droplet of whatever happens to fall on your shirt,
its definitely not going to hold up if you try to send a floor its way to see if the spot shield kicks in and works,
would buy again,
worth your money if you are looking for shirts of this type and don't want to have to spend too much to do so,
i was thinking it was going to have a little more room and it did not should of went with the size up one,
this a decent polo and very good for its price,
great fit,
its great for a work shirt,
doesn't shrink,
color and texture,
great for everyday casual use,
the shirts fit fine looking forward to order moore,
quality thick material and true to size,
'i purchased 4 colors &amp,
colors are vibrant,
"product is as advertised, fit was good",
i like this shirt,
it fits well,
"one year later , the seam underneath the right arm came apart",
i think i washed  it about 20 times,
i’m not sure i will buy this brand again,
it fits well and looks great,
but is far from comfortable and feels very low quality,
good fabric,
the color is not as depicted,
"it is much more of an electric, shocking blue and it is not attractive",
my husband is using it to wear around the house only,
"but, even then, we both dislike it",
"if he hadn't already worn it for a day, we would have returned it",
"stained pretty quick, a little oil from a salad dressing and i have spots on the shirt",
"fits well, decent material",
don't wear if girlfriend likes oil n vinegar salads,
great shirt for the price,
it's lighter weight fabric than a true polo,
size ordered fit perfectly,
beautiful color,
washed up nicely,
"i do not dry in dryer, always air dry on drying racks",
will be purchasing more,
this was a very inexpensive shirt,
but fits and wears well,
a great value for the price,
great quality for the price,
i bought these in many colors for my son for work in the summer,
casual office,
and he wears them all the time,
"fabric has an ok feel, more like a textured cotton,",
but not rough at all,
"these are not the super soft polos,",
but they do not pill and wash nicely,
good value,
nice work shirt that fits as expected,
"very comfortable, always looks great after each washing",
the product info said tag free which is very important to my husband and they are not tag free,
great fitting shirt for my husband,
ended up buying three of these shirts in different colors,
comfortable and true to size,
cheap polo,
fit real wonderful real nicely,
"got these for my husband for work, as he has to wear green polos, and they arrived quickly, were good qualiyty and fit well",
will buy again when he needs replacements,
it just doesn't look right,
the shirt is good quality,
i loved how fast the order came,
i needed a nice new polo for work,
it is super comfy and helps keep me dry with the moisture wicking,
i will be ordering more of this product in the future,
"good quality, nice color, will order another one",
nothing like the tagless picture,
i bought these because they were supposed to be tagless,
i bought 3 total in various colors,
but haven't received the other 2 yet,
i'll update for size when i get them and have worn them,
"these run way too big, for a large size anyway",
i ordered two different colors and both were tremendously large,
i'm not a little dude either,
was as described,
fit right no complaints,
love these shirts,
great quality for the price,
"since ordering, i've only wore these to work and continue to do so",
"they're a slim fit, light wear",
i've ordered more in different color,
would recommend for casual wear and office jobs,
great fit,
breathes well,
"i'm a thin guy and well-fitting shirt sizes are always somewhere between a small and a medium, depending on the brand",
in this case the medium i ordered is too large,
i was surprised to find that it was not eligible for return to amazon,
as advertised works great,
the 3x i ordered fit like a 4x,
this shirt has good quality for an excellent price,
not top designer merch,
but of a quality much better than one would expect for its price,
i will definitely be going back for some other colors,
"like the value for the price,",
"but material is thinner, as expected",
"arms are a little snug,",
but overall i would recommend it,
"my husband loves the way this shirt fits, and feels on him",
i waited to review until after a few washing’s,
this is really close to 5 stars,
"fits well, launders well",
it’s really close except for one minor thing,
the sleeve cuffs roll up and stay rolled up even after fixing them,
"still an excellent, lightweight shirt",
great everyday casual polo,
the price definatly does not depict the quality,
they are super nice,
great price,
i would 100% recommend and repurchase,
gorgeous looks high end true to size,
very comfortable will buy again,
not fitting as expected,
sleeve length is little longer,
very good progress satisfy,
"the shirt is cut well, and the color is good",
"it isn't a faded black,",
but rather a deep black,
but i had to return the shirt because the medium fit more like a small,
"i've ordered a large to replace it, and i might have to make it an xl if the large is cut small",
nice,
these shirts are nice,
"well made, easy care, and inexpensive",
a lot bigger than what i'm used to a size 2x normally is,
"i got this as a gift for my husband, he loves it",
"i asked if it was comfortable to wear, and he said it was",
me gustó el color,
la utilizo por días próximos a la navidad,
these shirts are true to size and fit very well,
they are a little thinner than some so it’s definitely a summer shirt,
"overall, i’m very pleased, especially with the price",
bought two as they are worn 4-5 days per week to work,
"have washed several times, color stays, no pilling, and wrinkle free after 10 minutes of drying",
bought for my boyfriend,
the shirt looks good,
it is a little thread bare and the collar is tight if you have a thicker neck,
coming out of the package smells awful,
but you get what you pay for,
i love the color,
"not a terrible buy,",
but not something i would recommend to other people,
"it's a fine shirt: it feels good, fits comfortably, and has the kind of lighter green color i was seeking to add to my wardrobe",
great shirt,
wore it to work and actually had compliments,
they are just okay,
they were to long i ordered the correct size,
perfect packaging,
was the right size and the material is comfortable,
"ok item, just heavier than expected",
returned due to arriving too late,
"gift purchase, recipient happy with fit, color, and style",
my daughter needed black polos for work and they proved harder than expected to find locally,
"these fit great, were very reasonably priced, and so far are working out great",
will definitely order more when she needs them,
"i ordered a medium, thinking it would fit how i wanted it to",
"these must be big and tall sizes or something, because their medium is like a 2xl",
ridiculous,
runs small,
it is a perfect fit and the color is sweet,
"great for the price,",
but a bit of a pain to find the right size - really too big for the size labeled,
"for the price, it's hard to go wrong",
they are inexpensive long sleeve polos,
production quality is fine,
"the fit is, as expected for the size",
"the material is a little on the thin side,",
but i wasn't expecting much to begin with,
"i use these as work shirts, they are fine for the purpose",
perfect polo shirt to be worn for all ocassions,
solid sewing and durable design,
i am definitely buying more,
given as a gift seems to be good,
great quality product for price,
great fit,
got for my husband new job fits perfect,
"the poly blend didn’t breath, i’m outdoors often in alabama heat",
all cotton for me,
great product,
"awesome quality, value, &amp",
price,
these shirts fit about a size smaller than what you normally wear,
be sure to order 1 size larger an you normally wear and they will fit fine,
"great quality for uniform shirts, would purchase again",
first day i wore it i saw a tear at the wrist part of the sleeve,
but i guess you get what you pay for they were cheap long sleeve shirts i bought to wear to work,
bought for vacation fit as expected would def recommend,
"for my grandson ,for him to wear to school it wears an it looks good",
i will order again,
thank you s,
smith,
good quality,
shirt is plain and true to size,
looks ok,
good for the price,
i read some of the comments and i wasnt expecting much,
"however, the shirt is not bad for the price and fits great",
"wash’s without fading, no shrinkage and holds up fine",
usually wear xxl,
but fits slightly big which is fine since i layer under it,
very nice kite shirt,
"nice quality shirt, fit perfectly, soft, very comfortable",
i'll be buying more shirts like this,
shirts are great fiy,
good value,
my husband is a big man,
likes his shirts big,
wears 5x fits perfectly,
i own a janitorial company,
i purchased 2 mens xl,
the sleeves are long enough so the arm cuff doesn't annoy,
"while cleaning, fits well on a 180 lb, 6 ft man",
seller is great to work with as well,
"not true size, too big",
esta bonito pero que quedó geande,
not a bad shirt,
but i was looking more for a polo shirt weave for the fabric,
but it’s pretty much a t-shirt with a collar,
also wanted a darker shade of navy blue than the color i got,
"the shirt fits a little close,",
but i fear the next size up would be too loose,
i was a bit disappointed,
fabric a little thin,
"sizing good, color selection limited,",
but at  $12 a shirt really can't complain,
i found these shirts to be very comfortable and roomy and very reasonably prices,
it claims to be a large,
it's clearly a small,
good,
wore the shirt one time and got a small spot on it,
wont come out,
i would not recommend the product,
great shirt,
fits my husband perfect,
this was a nice shirt at a good price,
"fit well, would buy it again",
this shirt is extremely see through,
my son loves it,
beautiful color and material not heavy,
it's a little short on the length,
still good though,
"quality fine i was just so surprised it ran big, almost everything now a days runs really small",
perfect fit,
even as a small the length is perfect,
"fits me well, very comfortable to wear",
"likes-the fit of the shirt,the price and being able to find the items online when it is so hard to find in the store",
dislikes-that the same styles and colors are not as economically priced thereby reducing the amount of shirts i may want to purchase and that xxl is not among those styles and colors,
fit's my 10 yeah prefect,
i got him a size small,
in the men's shirts he can do a size 14-16,
but it's just easier to get a small men's for him,
love the material,
very soft yet has substance,
it fit okay,
really wanted more of a cotton material,
very comfortable and soft,
fits perfectly,
the shirt fits nice - comfortable - and the blue is as bright as indicated by the online picture,
soft and fit great,
bought these for my son for school,
they fit him perfectly,
he’s 16 &amp,
6’1 slim build,
i will order again,
great shirt super fast shipping,
the shirt was great quality,
however it was not a woman’s xlarge it was definitely men’s,
the shirt was huge,
looks great,
comfortable,
launders well,
i ordered several colors and i like them,
be sure to wash them in the delicate cycle,
very nice shirt,
better than i expected,
i have many of these jerzees sport polo shirts and they all fit and feel comfortable,
"on my recent purchase one came with a tag that i thought would be tag-less,",
but i'll get over it,
my husband is very satisfied with this shirt,
it looks great on him,
"nice shirt, great fit",
exactly as described,
"after first wash, no good",
"some of them say 50% cotton and yet the description says 100% cotton, so i wasn't sure what i would get,",
"but these are definitely 50%, and feel thin like that, not as thick as a 100% cotton would be",
"but for the price, it's good",
the sleeves of the xl go a bit past my elbow,
"i'm 6'2""",
and too long to leave untucked,
also seems really boxy,
comfortable,
great for work,
very roomy cut on the sleeves and shoulders can move freely,
very comfortable and sturdy,
"its good,",
but could be better,
sleeves long enough that t-shirt doesn't pro out beneath them,
comodidad y que da muy bien,
no justo ni muy ancho,
i worry when purchasing clothing,
i am totally happy with my purchase,
i like the shirt,
i had ordered two shirts and i may even order a couple more,
"for whatever reason, water beads up on this as if it is covered in rain-x",
holds size and shape well,
doesn't shrink very much,
sleeves are nice and short - they don't go past the elbow like many cheaper polos trying to fit the masses,
i wanted a heavier shirt and threw this one away,
if you want thin material then this shirt is otherwise fine,
it is a shirt,
reasonable 'bang for the buck',
"very thin, can see through the white shirt",
some reviewers said the shirt was too big,
i have long arms so ordered sixe xl,
i'm not over weight and thought overall size might be too big,
but its a perfect fit for me,
"soft, comfortable, and reasonably priced",
would order again,
husband wears all the time,
great value work shirt,
"work shirt , not alot to say",
buy it already,
finally found a polo shirt i like,
ordered two more and i'm all set for spring and summer,
very nice shirt,
great value,
fits nice have no complaints,
the small fits me very well,
"i am 5’8”, 140 lbs, and usually wear a misses size 4 or 6",
the fabric is just a tad solid for me,
great value,
he loved it,
comfy,
great,
exactly as expected,
"great quality, price is worth it",
"very thin material and almost see through, more like a long sleeve tee-shirt",
not even a beefy or hefty tee,
with collars than a polo shirt,
love the shirt nice and warm,
as a cotton blend the fabric should wear well and not shrink or lose shape like the 100% cotton shirts,
"however, this trade off makes the shirt not so soft or comfortable",
fabric,
while lighter weight than all cotton should wear well as blends normally do,
stitching is fine no overt defects,
overall i'm happy,
i love this shirt,
it's plain,
but it's so comfortable you cam wear it for any occasion,
great purchase,
you can't beat the price on these shirts,
nice shirt for the price,
just a little too long,
great fit nice quality perfect for school uniform,
the shirt was ok until it was washed once terrible product terrible clothing don’t buy this,
larger than what the actual size,
got a large and was like an extra large,
very thin not good at all for fall or winter,
kind of disappointing,
i bought a 4x and it’s just not made for the big and tall man,
the shirt fits as it should,
i like that the sleeves are long enough to end at the elbow,
i waited until i laundered it a couple of times before i composed this review,
the shirt washes well,
"overall, the purchase was a good deal",
"this is a disposable shirt, it lasted one day",
totally unexusable,
i found this shirt to be a little oversized and droopy,
it got worse after a washing,
"probably worth $12,",
but i would recommend you spend the $16 on the premium polo,
"it’s a red, long sleeve, “dress",
” shirt that fits as expected,
good job,
5 stars,
"great shirt, fits well &amp",
cant beat the price,
"bright,colorful",
my son loved it,
great for the price,
i would air dry as opposed to using heat,
it will shrink otherwise,
"nice material , fits as expected",
product was small and the thinnest of material,
amazon essentials was twice the product,
very good quality &amp,
excellent price,
i love having my shirts one and half to two sizes too big,
"especially my work shirts, and these delivered beautifully",
love this shirt,
feels comfortable and the fit is perfect,
arrived as expected and i plan to purchase more colors of this jersey,
"thin material, will not hold up long in wash",
if you want a really cheap polo this is it,
"quality is low,",
but fits pretty good,
i would buy your standard polo size,
"they aren't very tight fitting so if ""slim fit"" is your thing look elsewhere",
if you're into slim fit you should be spending more and getting a better polo anyway,
after washing them they fit just as expected,
the cuffs are a little too tight,
but everything else is great,
"good quality fabric, color as shown, price was right, fit as expected",
i needed these for work and they did not disappoint,
too bad women are not allowed to purchase this quality in feminine styles,
ordered one of these for my husband and he loved the light weight material for summer,
it’s not thin that you can see thru,
but was very cool and breathable he said,
size runs true to size - we ordered 2 more since,
hubble loves them,
perfect for work,
"good price, fits great",
not happy,
did not shrink up that's great,
too stretchy like elastic,
great shirt for work,
the quality is good and these look great with dress pants,
i receive a lot of compliments on the shirt,
they are somewhat lightweight,
but very comfortable,
"i bought this long sleeve polo for my young adult son, who just started working in a cold store",
good material and comfortable,
"fast shipping, easy transaction",
i'll be buying a couple more,
fabric isn’t very soft,
but it fits like i expected it to and i don’t see any problems even after the first wash,
i thought ordered women’s which i’m certain i did and i received men’s,
quality not as good as i’d like it to be,
but for price it’s exceptable,
would have like what i ordered,
please be careful when picking items,
fixs good runs just a bit small,
but as you wear it it loosens up would buy again,
"for the price, you can't really complain about this product",
"that said, it is a little oversized and has a rather blousey fit",
"even so, i would have been fine with it except, not only did it take almost two weeks to arrive,",
but when it did they had sent the wrong color,
it's a comfortable shirt with the color as advertised on the amazon page,
"it's not very thick though so if you use it in cooler temperatures, make sure you have appropriate outerwear to accompany it",
my dad likes them so much,
great shirt for everyday around the house,
runs small,
need one size up,
i'm stuck with 3 too small,
true for lee,
very nice and a great value,
a mi hijo le agrado,
these are great fitting shirts for the price,
shrinkage is minimal,
the fit  is muscular,
"if you need more room, i would suggest you up your normal size",
very comfortable pull over for every occasion i recommended your family and friends,
right for the price,
"definitely thinner then what i expected,",
"but other then that, it’s great",
dress up or dress down,
bday present for dad &amp,
he likes it,
fits him well and seemed like quality work as i wrapped it,
its ok,
great shirt right out of package,
"first wash was on cold/cold,",
but still shrunk a tad,
get one size up to compensate,
nice quality lightweight shirt for the money,
i really liked them they fit him perfect thanks again,
great fit,
just sleeves wrinkle on the edges as it appears to be a little large in my opinion,
other than that great product,
not bad at all,
"very comfortable shirt,  washing and drying are easy",
love the color,
nice shirt,
seems well made of quality material,
not too thin,
colors are nice,
great for the office,
my son likes them,
there pecfect fi for school very comfortable,
"been through two washes since i got it and it held up great, no shrinking",
very comfortable,
my only complaint is that currently they don't have,
but 3 colors in my size available or i would buy a few more,
i like the material,
but too small,
ordered the white shirt and one can definitely not wear this in public:  its see through,
awful,
just awful,
waste of $$ for this,
i’ve seen 30 year old t shirts that were thicker than this,
good casual jersey with jeans,
i thought it would have more polyester,
husband loved,
great value for price,
washes well with no fading,
timely delivery of the best long-sleeved collared shirts - just what i needed to wear for my job at our new supermarket,
i found this shirt to fit very loosely,
"i am 5' 10"" and i ordered a medium",
i returned it immediately,
i went with the dickies brand which was 2 dollars cheaper and way better quality,
oh and it had a strong color die smell,
"the fabric was nice and bright red as hoped,",
but a bit thin,
"i was hoping it was more of a rugby-weight fabric,",
but it is more of a t-shirt weight,
cuff around wrist &amp,
"forearms were a bit small,",
but the shirt fit well,
i wore it and people gave me compliments,
specially the light blue one,
you too can laugh at trumpers,
nice cotton polo,
great color and true to size,
exactly as advertised,
fits well,
the shirt had no issues,
great jeez e polo,
"as expected,",
but the material has a coarse feel for a polyester,
not a problem unless you want a soft fabric against your skin- or your girl's,
very nice,
arrived just as expected,
love the color &amp,
material,
"thin, not what i was looking for",
my husband really likes this because it's soft and lightweight,
"i love it because of it's easy care just wash, dry and on the hanger",
color is just as pictured and washes up great,
holds shape and feels good,
fit is as expected and soft,
awesome quality tees,
hubby totally loves them,
we got 2 colors so far and will soon get some more,
"now it's 53% polyester, 47% cotton, it seems causing faster sweating due to rise in body temperature",
50%/50% was as far as they could go with this garment,
"the sizes run a little small,",
but the xl fits perfect,
i am somewhere between a large and an xl,
great equality nice fit true to size,
exactly what we wanted,
"great shirt, light matetial, good quality and comfortable",
i recommend highly,
bought for use on my job,
good fit overall,
banding on sleeves needs to be eliminated,
too tight for men with bigger arms,
overall a great value,
fits as expected,
but i’m a small framed person 5’9” and 125 pounds so,
comfortable and well made,
thanks,
fits good,
gift for son in law,
"great color, fits perfectly and is comfortable",
awesome,
"somewhat large,",
but i’m 100% it’ll shrink a bit after washing it in the washing machine and drying it in the dryer,
like the fit color was lighter than expected,
fits perfect,
material has a nice feel,
perfect weight for me,
we'll see what happens after washing,
the price is right,
good for the price,
more like a long sleeve t-shirt material,
thin,
but comfortable,
it works,
great for the price,
quality will show after a couple of washes,
i feel like the arms were unnecessarily long,
but maybe this is by design,
i am going to order more of these shirts in a couple of different colors,
my husband looked good and felt comfortable in this shirt,
very good value price,
washed up nice and kept its shape,
i washed in cold water and light dry before he wore it,
don’t buy white,
"very thin, almost see through",
blue one is ok,
my son did not like the colors,
he said they looked like uniforms that should be monogrammed instead of everyday polo shirts,
i will be returning them,
"i wore it once or twice, i just don't care for the finished look after washing",
it looks cheap,
oh it was cheap,
"based on other excellent reviews about this product, i purchased this shirt",
i'm disappointed,
"i purchased large,",
but size seems to fit xl,
material is not of great quality,
color seems to fade away in couple of washes,
i would recommend you to look for other options,
i liked how well it fit,
i was originally concerned about the 50/50 cotton and polyester,
but it turned out fine,
"i am very impressed how many good reviews have this very cheap product, after the second wash it was worthless",
do not understand anything above 1 star of this very thin and wrinkled fabric,
ok,
nice shirt for the price,
"deep color, washed well",
wears very nicely,
price,
nice value for a slim fit as noted by others,
a medium will fit the way a lee large fits,
perfect,
"every day bssic shirt, would be perfect as school uniform, not a fancy dressier polo",
sent it back,
i'm very pleased with the jerzee's long sleeve polo shirts,
"the cotton blend is comfortable, and seems wrinkle-resistant",
"the fit is as i expected, and i think they are perfect for southern winters",
excellent,
my husband uses these for work shirts,
so they get worn and washed every week with no fading or pilling,
nice fabric,
feels good and looks good after wash &amp,
dry,
fit a bit snug compared to usual xl,
but has long tail and stays in my trousers,
great shirt for the money,
a little thin on the material,
but good,
excellent,
purchased these for my uncle,
hey loves them,
i will be purchasing more in the future,
"it fit good, not to ride or loose just right",
material is very thin and almost see through,
bought for my husband,
it fit perfect,
used it for family pictures,
good fit,
holds up through washes,
the man of the house really loved these shirts,
i got them in a couple of colors for him,
the collar structure was was fine not too loose or slack and the shirt fit his frame just fine,
i'll definitely will be getting more,
the material is a bit thin,
but i think it's ok,
looking to purchase maybe size smaller than the xl,
this good is good quality and true to size,
good fit,
very comfortable,
had to wash before wearing as they had a strange almost petroleum like odor,
washing them removed the odor,
great shirt,
product as expected,
i have other jerzee polo shorts that were really good in ready to wear and life of short,
delivered promptly and as expected,
"the quality of material is not the best,",
but it’s worth the price,
gorgeous,
very comfortable,
i got this for my husband for a one time occasion that he needed it,
but he now wears it every week and is wanting to buy another one,
it’s one of his favorite shirts,
comfortable,
bought for work perfect,
"launders nicely, didn't fade",
good fit,
"nice and soft, feels good when worn",
fits good,
bought one just to see the quality,
look and feels great,
this shirt monogrammed so easily and looked great when i finished i,
fits good and feels like a quality shirt,
this shirt fits my brother perfectly and is very comfortable,
the color is vibrant,
great polo shirt very comfy,
"poor quality, material does no breath",
very nice,
this is a nice summer polo,
washes well,
but tends to get saggy after a few washes,
that's why i took a star off,
great uniform shirt for school,
great for school uniform,
mandaron una bolza llena de basura parece que la recojieron de un safacon,
"i like that it was t-shirt material, not hot in the fl summer, fits right for size",
love it,
have been looking for years for a long sleeve polo shirt,
--- just what i wanted,
i bought this for my husband and he really likes it,
it's comfortable and is long enough in the sleeve to fit his longer arms,
"good colors, i bought the red and white ones",
i haven't washed them yet as he has only just received them,
they have a good choice of colors too so i'll be buying more,
material is not so soft otherwise is good deal,
runs small,
heavy material - good way to sweat your ass off,
good value,
"wore the grey one, fit great",
very good quality,
"great shirt, especially when you consider the price",
"nice enough to wear to work and to wear on the weekends, too",
what a buy,
nice fit and feel overall,
"i got an adult small for my ""normal"" sized 11 year old and the sleeves are a bit snug unfortunately",
it's for a school uniform and may not last long anyway,
worth the price despite the sleeve fit,
"well made, fits great",
very nice well made inexpensive shirt,
i'll be ordering more,
classy,
excellent polo shirts,
"color,size and quality are great",
would definitely buy from again,
fast shipping,
thanks again,
fits just right,
comfortable for work,
i bought the shirt for my son which he used for work and it has everything he needed,
the fit was excellent,
good,
exactly as described,
fits great,
would highly recommend and definitely purchase again,
loving it since i wear lots of white pants and clothing,
very snug and warm which would be good for the winter,
goes good with all my white dress pants too,
looks nice and my friend liked it,
it is a great buy for the money i spent,
"exactly what i expected, a nice collared tshirt",
super soft and comfortable,
jerzees men's spot shield short sleeve polo sport shirt washes well fits my husband perfectly,
uses for work,
"fits well, launders well",
i wear it all the time,
"decent quality,  nice light fabric",
but it was too big,
"just washed it so hopefully it shrunk a bit,",
but if not i should have ordered a size smaller,
nice shirts for work as a courier,
good product for the price,
"nice,",
but the cloth is on the thin side,
on the other hand that could be a positive thing when it comes to hot and humid days,
comfortable and fit great,
will buy more,
go a size smaller for good fit,
this is a very basic -,
but durable and versatile - long-sleeve polo,
i just wish they had more colors to choose from,
good find,
great and comfortable,
a++ seller,
"1 wash and it started to pill, very disappointing",
i'd return it if i could,
great shirt washes very well,
great purchase,
great shirt bought 4 colors for golf,
truly runs large order a size down,
"the fabric is actually quite soft for the price, which was surprising",
"it has faded a couple of times with washing, though",
we bought this in a pinch because we needed a black polo for something,
it did the job well,
great fit,
"feels well built, not thin",
"looks good, fits well and we'll see how it last",
i'm pleased with my purchase,
the extra large size is way to small,
it fit my wife perfectly and she wears a medium,
the people at jerzees must be from a different planet,
it's not the same quality as a $40,
"00 polo shirt,",
but it's a great deal when you consider the $6,
50 price,
"nice alternative to a t shirt, at the same price",
perfect for,
but dont wash warm,
wash cold to keep fit,
very cheap,
can't beat these shirts for the price and they are well made,
loved it,
"color, size, and feel of shirt is amazingly good",
i was extremely happy with this purchase,
i will be ordering more,
"these shirts are comfortable, durable, warm and stain resistant",
really a great product,
first rate item,
fair price,
for the price - this is an excellent shirt,
"not the softest fabric,",
but it fit to size and looks good,
i will order more colors,
really nice for the price,
runs a little big,
bought this for my husband for work and it looked even better in person,
nice shirt,
great buy- perfect for your golfer or sports guy,
good,
fits well,
looks good,
soft shirt and my husband loved it,
you can't beat this shirt for the value,
great work shirt for my son,
definitely a little more rough than cotton comfortable,
but it doesn't wrinkle at all,
"the shirt was ok,",
but the sleeves are too long reaching your elbows and the material is showing lint after few woshes,
color fast after one washing,
fits perfect,
material is soft yet durable,
"we got to the store late this year, thank you for having this shirt",
"my grandson loves this shirt, he wanted me to teach him how to wash, cold water wash love it/",
polyester content makes it uncomfortable in sports involving profuse sweating,
otherwise ok,
colours are excellent,
it fits well for me indeed,
great fit and comfortable,
fits perfect,
it is great to buy an extra large shirt and it fit like an extra large shirt,
i love these shirts,
i wear one every day to work,
these shirts were a nice surprise,
they drape wonderfully and make my chest and arms look great,
drapes smoothly,
there are no side cuts at the lower hem which is fine,
the finish on the arm ends looks nice,
got for my boyfriend for work,
"i know his chest is a 40, so crossed my fingers and got the large",
fits perfectly,
"he has very muscular arms and the arms are fitted around the cuff like he likes,",
but not too tight,
length is good too,
he’s 5’10”,
washed according to directions,
but did shrink a little otherwise pleased with product,
nice color and quality,
this shirt is not a fitted style so expect the waist to be as broad as the shoulders,
ripped seams,
never had anything wash up with so many wrinkles,
if you like to iron buy these,
la calidad de la tela no es de alta calidad,
all a1 wonderful,
looks good,
bright colors &amp,
great additions to my son's school uniform wardrobe,
"the shirt met my expectations, just a little long when worn outside",
good shirt for the price,
lightweight and thin,
basically a t shirt with a collar,
great for work,
this shirt is lightweight and not very soft,
considering the price i guess it's ok,
my $50 shirts are thicker and soft,
i thought i'd try this low cost shirt,
"so, bottom line is you get what you pay for",
nice and comfortable,
as advertised,
the price is ok,
but the products are not good,
it is too long and the sleeves are not the same,
"i am a female manager at a restaurant and this shirt is the perfect fit and cut to look professional, unlike most women's polos that are a bit thin and uncomfortable",
"my measurements are 39"" 30"" 44"" and somehow the shirt fits well without looking frumpy",
i boughtout larger expecting it to shrink a bit in the wash,
it did not shrink,
that's good though,
it's comfortable too,
like the style,
even had a logo put on the left hand upper chest side and it turned out great,
shirt was as described,
these fit perfectly and are great quality,
the price is extremely reasonable too,
just what i wanted,
material is thin and cheap feeling,
good shirt - my husband liked it a lot - looks good with dress or casual shorts for men,
comfortable for work,
i ordered this for a halloween costume and it was promised to arrive the next day,
arrived just as promised and was a nice shirt,
good value,
fits as expected,
pleased with all the color choices,
ordered 3,
hubby was happy with them,
textile just the right weight,
"not to light,",
but not too heavy,
just right,
bought again,
good fit and quality,
no shrinkage so far,
"much smaller than expected, and very thin material",
made very cheaply,
"the cuffs are a little tight, and after wearing it a full day, it feels too polyestery",
"but it fits well, has bright color and looks great",
fit as expected,
great shrts,
this is not like the picture,
mine has no white on edge of sleeves and bottom of shirt,
solid color only,
also runs small apparently,
was gift and he loved them,
shipping was fast great product works well will buy again,
this is the pullover shirt i was looking for,
our climate in my area goes from summer to spring most of the time,
hard to find a long sleeve pullover shirt,
seems to wear well and is easy to care for,
needed last minute blue polo,
perfect sizing for big and tall,
was very satisfied,
fit great,
i work in a restaurant and i wear a shirt and tie everyday,
my staff jokes that i am putting my drycleaners kid through college because i am always dripping on my shirts,
i decided to purchase several of these shirts in an effort to lower my dry cleaning bill,
"sure enough, i spilled on it my first time wearing it",
bacon grease most likely,
i didn't notice it until i put the shirt on after its next washing,
"sure enough, there is a stain on it",
so i threw the shirt away because the whole point was to not have stained shirts,
i haven't stained any of the others yet,
but this first one made me realized that the spot treatment they have isn't very valuable,
the other option is to be more careful and not spill as much food on my clothes as i do,
but we don't hold much hope for that,
luckily my drycleaners kid is a junior this year so i have plenty of time to find the right shirt,
ordered my size and came in way to big,
sleeves were past my elbows,
got this as a work shirt for my son who just started working at target,
"he's 6'3"" and super skinny, and the large fits him perfectly",
"i like the shirt, nice and lightweight",
but a little tighter than i expected for a 5x,
love the rich red color,
light weight,
forest green is just as pictured and matches our work logo perfect,
was looking for a light weight polo and these are perfect,
husband really likes them,
he's a high guy so it's hard to find stuff that fits,
but these fit perfectly,
"they also water resistant so when he sweat at work,his shirt is not drenched",
very thin,
fits as expected,
i purchased this for my son for a school uniform,
great work shirts,
cool &amp,
comfortable,
the shirt was too large,
excellent shirt for the fall to use as a uniform shirt,
could be worn for casual attire,
material is quite comfortable,
irons well,
good quality,
washes well,
i hang to dry,
"i needed to replace my wardrobe with stylish,",
but not expensive shirts,
pants will follow in a few months,
these shirts are one of my standards,
they endure repeated washing and wearing,
don't need ironing,
and look good everytime i go out in one,
i plan to by more of these shirts when my budget improves,
quality is not good,
"it's a good shirt that has a nice white color, which fits me because i often find myself in the mood to wear a white shirt",
and the color of the shirt is exactly as i anticipated from when i looked at it online,
very comfortable and relaxing,
best price and good quality,
as expected,
"after  a shingle wash, it's shrunk and too small to wear",
this shirt fits great and is nice to have for winter at my job,
i ended up buying 2,
"love it, good quality",
like the color and the fit,
the price is right and the shirt comes out of the dryer looking good,
did not wash up well,
wrinkles and will require ironing,
who liike's to iron?,
nice shirt,
i bought this for work and people complement me on it,
"it is form fitting, and the length is perfect",
not all shirts fit the same,
"i have some other ls polos and these are a little thinner, which is ok since i get warm easy",
shipping was fast,
fits great and the price is low,
perfect,
"i'm accustomed to tight arms, so i don't get too upset",
good buy for the money,
can recommend it,
good shirt at a great price,
ordered a mans large,
this product is so big an elephant could wear it,
terrible,
this polo fit was what i was hoping for,
i have a frame where some x-l's are too tight,
but xxl's look to big,
i guess you can say i'm a medium xl,
this shirt would work well with men that have broad shoulders where xxl is too large and an xl  normally would be a little tight,
use these at work as a red shirt at autozone,
it fits and looks good,
i usually don't like zipper collars,
but this works well,
bought these for my husband who is a little large,
they fit awesome and come out of the dryer wrinkle free,
"jerzee polo shirts are always made of soft, comfortable fabric and come in a great range of handsome colors",
a very nice find for the price,
the color is as pictured,
my son bought these shirts for his job,
they look nice and didn't shrink after washing them,
the advert said moisture wicking and low and behold i splashed dishwater up against my shirt,
"sure enough, the water just ran right off the shirt",
be getting more soon,
appears to be a good product,
it fits good,
great,
material was thinner than expected,
porque hice la orden manga larga,
y me salieron manga corta  y para no devolver las deje asi eso es lo unico no porque son comodas,
"very nice, rich color and has washed and worn well,",
but it is thin,
good for summer,
", wrinkles easily and holds dog hair, lint, etc like a boss",
"my husband likes the color and is perfectly fine with the thinness,",
but he hates how easily it picks up our dog's fur,
my husband has been wearing this for over a year and it fits perfect and it has not worn out at all in the color has not faded,
excelente,
i bought this for my boyfriend to wear as part of a gilligan costume,
as soon as he opened it and put it on he decided he would wear it long after the party we needed it for,
"it's a nice shirt, well made and fits perfectly",
the color and material are really nice for the price,
this is a gift to be used for work shirts,
perfect polo for work,
nice fabric,
washed well,
very comfortable pullover shirt,
"very cool, great material, super fit",
can't beat the pricing,
have several on them in different colors,
"great material, really nice fit, should have purchased more",
"but the user sold out, my bad",
the sleeves are to tight to push up your forearm,
not a bad shirt for the price,
looks and fits nicely,
i'd buy another shirt in the future,
soft and comfortable,
i have 5 and wear them all the time,
"i purchased a xl, usually my husband is a xl,",
"but i've been caught out before when purchasing online, needing a size  bigger or smaller",
xl was the perfect fit,
"great shirt, breathable material for the skin, plus after a wash, just hang dry, no need to iron - thank gawd",
simple no frills shirt suitable for work or everyday,
"alright shirt for the price, fits nice,",
"but material feels like it may not last, feels thin, i got the grey and white, i recommend dark colors because the white is kind of see through",
i love these shirts,
been wearing them for years and haven’t been able to find them where i live now so was delighted to find them and have them shipped to me,
brilliant,
no dislike,
work shirt,
material is thin,
poor fabric,
you get what you pay for,
best shirts ever,
"very good quality, i'm wearing it now as i'm typing",
i like it,
nice shirts,
these are the only ones i buy for work now,
they hold their color and are basically water and stain repellent,
the shirt is fine for the price,
but smaller than a typical mens medium shirt,
great work shirts,
great fit,
would definitely purchase again,
"this looked a little large when it came,",
but it fits great,
it's a man's shirt,
but i liked the reviews and i'm glad i bought it,
i'll check out the jerzees line of clothing again,
good value,
the best ten dollar polo i ever bought,
many thanks to you,
this is a great shirt,
my second jerzees shirt,
they fit nicely and as an foundation for layering they work well,
the other thing that i liked was amazon's price,
it was very competitive with similar shirts that i was looking at,
"i bought these to use as rehearsal shirts when i play trombone -  kept one, they probably would fit if i were still in my twenties,",
but being much older means they were quite snug around the middle,
very thin,
as a larger man i’m usually pretty weary of ordering clothes online,
but i took a chance with this shirt and it was better than expected honestly,
fit perfectly,
nice shirt at a fair price,
great material,
ok to wear on a weekend,
but would not wear to a casual/social event,
it does not feel as it will last more than a couple of washes,
these are better quality than expected for the price,
washes well no need to iron when pulled from dryer,
my husband loves this shirt,
it fits well and is well constructed,
tight on the sleeves drove him crazy and ended up cutting them off,
lol,
if fit so well that i’m waking on more to come in,
shirt fits well and met all my expectations and the sleeves won't stretch like a lot of these kinds of shirts normally do,
the shirts weren't even packaged they almost seemed like these were shirts i bought used,
the cloth material looks and feels cheap,
if you are large wear a medium because the sizes on these shirts are way off,
great shirt,
ordered many colors,
"black, navy, gray and royal blue",
the material is light and airy,
not heavy or bulky like some,
will be,
the perfect shirt for this coming spring,
this shirt fits and looks as expected,
quality shirt at a great price point,
good quality,
learned not to dry the shirt,
perfect shirt for what i was looking for,
"poly/cotton blend was a bit warmer than i anticipated,",
but i am fat and just need to lose some weight,
great shirt,
i will purchase several more of these,
"i like it a bit large- washes well, not wrinkly at collar",
satisfied,
got both grey and navy,
lightweight fabric,
my daughter works at target,
i bought the shirts for her to wear to work,
she says they’re perfect,
good buy,
goid fit,
"like my clothes loose, not clingy",
does not shrink after washing,
"nice, bright true red color",
fit is good,
arrived as promised,
thank you,
"great shirt, feels comfortable and looks professional",
dad liked it,
perfect,
"great polo shirts, great material use for work weekly i have put them in dryer and they do not shrink",
hubby loves these shirts,
bought several colors 'cause these are his go-to shirts every day,
can't go wrong with these great shirts for the quality and the price,
highly recommended,
"shirt fits, no defects or weird shape",
loved it,
"this is a nice lightweight shirt, comfortable",
haven't washed and dried it yet ao  i hope it doesn't shrink,
these are good standard polos for every day use,
they fit as expected and hold color well for me,
great value,
great shirt,
i originally purchased 2 for my grandson for school,
he liked them so much ordered more,
perfect for his school colors,
i recommend highly,
i purchased these for my catering staff and they are holding up nicely to the abuse we are throwing at them,
"multiple events and no stains so far, quite pleased",
they also breathe more than other polos we've used since they are 50/50 cotton/polyester,
would definitely recommend,
nice and comfy,
great value,
washed up well,
very light weight shirt,
i haven't washed it yet,
but it is perfect as a summer weight polo shirt,
great buy,
i bought this for my 99 year old father because he needs long sleeves,
he wanted to sleep in it he loved it so much,
sorry can't answer your  questions,
it is a christmas present and i wrapped as soon as it arrived,
"i thought the fabric felt a little cheap, thin, and scratchy",
i gave it to my father-in-law and now it's his favorite shirt,
so who knows?,
nothing fancy,
but fit as expected and excellent price,
i bought it for my husband,
it is a good fit for him,
it made a student,
he lacked a white shirt as part of his uniform,
very happy at christmas,
it is  easy to maintain,
i intend to buy him some more,
great quality shirt--my son loves it,
good material and fits great,
great shirt for bigger guys,
product is as expected,
they do run big,
for my guy i should have ordered a small,
but he is a husky,
washes and dries great,
as soon as dryer stops i take out and hang up,
looks great even after a few more washings,
hope i get the year out of it,
looks like i will and then some,
"contrary to what some reviewers had said, the size is true to fit, at least for the medium size which i bought",
it hard for me to get a comfortable shirt,
i’m a big guy,
this one is perfect,
bought one originally to see how it would fit and it was perfect,
the material is not cheap so it didn’t shrink after i washed it,
i immediately bought more,
as described,
bad,
just wanted some reasonably priced polo's to wear in lieu of t-shirts,
these are much better than i could have hoped fo,
i can wear these anywhere,
"ordered a xl for my boyfriend and it's very large,",
but he's kind of an ibtween large and xl guy so just going to keep it and hope with a few washes it shrinks a little,
"great color , lightweight summer shirt",
my husband like it,
he looks so handsome 😍,
got 2 of these for my son who works at a place that needs collared shirts,
"fits nice, washes easily and looks nice",
excellent quality,
"fit was fine,",
but the quality is cheap,
"you get what you pay for - thin, sloppy seams, and doesn't look nice",
something i'd expect to see at walmart,
am pleased with the jersey,
it fits well and the royal blue color is vibrant,
it is well worth the money i paid,
but i'm unsure if i'll buy another because i like a little thicker material,
nothing,
it’s good,
very slender arms,
very happy good fit,
great value,
as pictured,
"fit was ok,",
but material was very not-soft and not-comfortable,
returned,
i like the jerzees brand,
good fit and they don't shrink,
too long,
i usually wear a large,
i'm 16,
5 and 34/35,
but this shirt is larger than other size large that is usually get from the gap or old navy,
"however, the company gotapparel was insanely nice about the return",
they credited my account and told me not even to ship the item back,
i will now try purchasing a size medium,
"my husband likes these shirts, personally i find the fabric too thin",
the fit is good and it shrunk only very little,
the collar and cuffs are  holding up well,
i  recommend these shirts for the price and the quality,
it fits,
this was a gift for my brother and he liked the shirt color and fit,
a good shirt at a very reasonable price,
"nice fabric, fit as expected, color was bright as pictured",
nic,
e looking shirt on,
we got this because it was half the price of the brand names shirts,
"we were very pleased that it was soft , and yes it does repel stains",
the shirt is for my 90 year old father and it is very comfortable for him,
perfect fit,
i am a larger woman wear a womens 2xl i needed a longer sleeve to cover my upper arms and me this shirt fit perfect,
"quick shipping, great shirt, and it fits perfectly",
highly recommend,
thin and soft,
color and size was exactly as stated,
fits nice,
great shirt well woth the money,
here also i was advised that the polo runs large so ordered a smaller size,
"this fit well, wore well and washed nicely without",
shrinkage,
very satisfied with the product and ordered more in different colors,
perfect,
it was a wonderful product,
i will definitely recommend amazon services to my friends,
thanks a lot again,
i liked the shirt very much,
it was a great quality and fit perfect,
perfect fit,
"great material, nice polo for the price",
fit,
the shirt is great,
my only reservation is that it is significantly larger than other shirts i have which are also size large,
"it isn't a problem,",
but i am having it shortened a bit,
i bought these shirts for my 12 yo uniform shirts,
the  school's logo was embroidered on them,
they fit perfect and the material is good quality and able to stand up to the wear and tear from a middle schooler,
my husband loves his green shitt,
amazing i freaking love it,
nice,
they give me wrong color and wrong tshirt it doesn't look like the picture,
i am wearing it for the first time today,
it seems to be good quality,
i did notice the neck hole is a little small for a 2-xxl,
may be it will stretch a little,
"i prefer wearing shirts with collars, so it was nice to find a polo with long sleeves for the winter time",
inexpensive and not the most quality  fabric,
but still a great shirt,
i love this shirt,
needed it for a uniform,
is perfect,
my grandson loves the shirt,
these are very comfortable and they have held up nicely through the washer and dryer,
"the fabric didn't sag, fade or crumple up",
i ordered a size to large,
but i adjusted it to my size and am very happy with them,
the fabric was good quality,
color true to what it showed when ordering,
"fit as expected, did not shrink in the wash, looks nice on my husband",
"the texture was more on the cotton side than i expected with a poly/cotton blend,",
but this is one of the tops i like to wear during the christmas season because i am santa claus,
can beat it for the $$,
my husband is a big guy and finding shirts for work that fit him is sometimes a battle,
"these polo shirts are the best we have found, they don't shrink in the dryer and they iron well and a true size",
we will continue to buy this product,
thanks,
good standard quality work shirt,
a bit thin,
very poor quality,
ridiculously thin material,
i bought a box of rags that were better quality,
perfect fit for me in size large,
feels like good quality polos for work especially,
"fits great, soft, comfortable",
perfect for work  and layer when is cold outside,
fit my son perfectly,
he needed a work shirt and this worked out great,
comfortable,
i washed twice and still looks like new ☺ good price too,
i found this polo to be way too long - both the sleeves and body,
i have purchased several jerzees long sleeve t-shirts and have been happy with them,
but this one is going to the goodwill,
more of a thick t-shirt material than polo pique,
for the price iits probably ok and cut is not bad,
the material is very thin and there's a hole in the clothing,
there seems to be very little quality control over these products,
bought for grandson to meet navy blue uniform requirements,
un poco,
larga pero lo peor es que el cuello perdio la forma,
inmedatamente,
well packaged and fast delivery,
fits good and is comfortable fit,
great fit,
soft material,
keeps its size after washing,
"i like that the product held its shape, color, and new quality appearance",
highly recommend this product,
great quality shirt,
it's all good,
have gotten many compliments,
it was for work,
"utilized these as work shirts, definitely comfortable",
"was a little lacking on the moisture wicking, especially on cold days",
"but overall, decent shirts",
"great quality, good fit, will buy more",
my husband needed some long sleeved shirts,
he likes them alot,
just what i wanted for golf on cooler mornings,
nice shirt for a polo long-sleeve,
good deal  thank you,
nice shirt and color a little big for my husband,
but still looks good,
you can see through the shirt and have to wear an undershirt,
the material isn't comfortable at all,
lightweight and comfortable,
i bought this shirt because i needed a green shirt for a christmas party and no store near me had a green shirt,
"this can be a unisex shirt, i put a pretty scarf around the collar and its a womans polo shirt",
price was great,
it was exactly as it was when i ordered it last time hit me the way i wanted it i am happy and will order more overtime,
"this in not the royal blue, short sleeve polo i purchased",
toosmall,
a comfortable wear and fit,
idea for hot weather,
decent,
great,
so much cheaper than buying a uniform shirt from the store,
nice quality shirt for a low price,
terrible shirt,
",it arrived with a ravle in the sleave,size is way too small",
the shirt split at the seam in the arm,
looks nice and feels good,
not soft,
but still good,
the material is on the thin side,
great value,
nice plain white polo with long sleeves,
got it to go under a sweater vest,
the fabric was not as soft as i had hoped,
but it will certainly work out just fine,
it was also a little bigger than i expected and didn't seem to shrink in the wash,
i got the large and it fit like a tent,
way too big,
fits great,
seems durable,
great shirt,
"great shirt,nice shirt goes well for casual dress",
as advertised,
"i like the color, hope it doesn't bleed in wash",
great shirt,
fits perfect like athletic shirts,
it's not a pique,
total retro,
total awesome,
i would buy again if i needed a different color,
"i am 157lbs 5""8",
sometimes i wear a large some times i wear a med,
"this shirt runs a little big, so i went with med",
great product,
it's fine,
i love it,
i bought 2,
i wear them for work,
wanted a cheap polo that would hold up for 6 months and i think they will,
washed them a few times and they seem to hold up,
fits well and looks good,
wears really well,
very cheap looking,
waste of money,
my son wears it for work,
so far it's very durable,
got this for my son,
got exactly as expected,
he said it was comfortable too,
great for son's school uniforms,
"it’s fine,",
but not much quality,
nice shirt,
"i almost always wear polos, so when i saw the price i got it",
woow,
never buy this again,
order large,
"but come in like xxl, it way tooooo big",
cheap material,
dont buy,
great shirt,
fits like it should,
definitely a good price,
"looks good, good size",
"the shirt fits well, really nice and comfortable",
"fabric is too thin, especially for a white shirt",
bought for my grandson to wear to work,
this item is very nice,
but slightly bigger than expected,
but ok,
the quality of material appears to be very comfortable,
i have ordered two more of the same brand,
two different size,
the only thing i did not like is the difference in price for the same item when you change the color,
good value,
good comfortable shirt,
got it for work at a dollar a store,
not happy with the sleeve cuffs,
the cuffs turn/roll under and look strange,
otherwise a comfortable and decent shirt,
i got what i expected,
quality shirt that fit true to size,
color as described,
"i bought them for work, and will order again",
perfect fit,
this is perfect,
just what i was looking for,
will buy more items from this seller in the future,
steal of a deal,
these shirts are just awesome for the price,
not very nice,
fit nicely and like the bright color,
i like jerzee clothing because it is good quality,
love it,
"while i expected it to be more of a golf shirt, i was pleased to find that it was a different material",
"it's comfortable, breathable &amp",
light,
"the shirt feels very soft, it is not the typical polo feel where you can feel the texture of the thread",
it definitely has a lighter feel like a t-shirt,
great shirt and durable,
price can’t be beat,
these have washed well without fading or shrinking,
"my son wears them for school uniform, so we wash them sometimes twice a week",
"the price per shirt saved my sanity, and i was able to get the size i needed without a problem",
merchandise was as advertised and received in a timely manner,
i bought this shirt to help cover my arms,
while on a shore exertion for a cruise to the western caribbean,
i wore it to work on a cold day - just to see how well if fit,
that shirt is very comfortable,
i'm looking forward to wearing it again on one of the shore exertions that we've got coming up,
the shirt was so comfortable that i bought 2 more in different colors,
"if the need arises where i need more, i'll buy more of these shirts",
nice feel,
love the material,
fits perfectly,
great price,
fits great good quality,
awesome,
shirts are very comfortable,
size is  just right,
was on the large side and the shirt is pretty thin,
would almost need to wear an un undershirt under it,
it is that thin,
would not buy again and most importantly could not return for these reasons,
shirt fits as expected,
comfortable and perfect fit,
ok  fir the price not great,
this item is worth the 6 bucks i paid for it,
it's casual and nice to wear on the fly,
steam iron to get the wrinkles out,
super fast s&amp,
item is as described,
my kids have to wear school uniforms affordability and look is really important,
i orderred a white one for kid's uniform,
it is thin and almost transparent,
"it's my mistake, i keep it and wear as an underlayer only",
"next time, i will buy those things in store where i can see the merchandise",
it was good took a few washes to soften up,
fits nicely and washes great,
liked it very much,
warm for this cold winter,
the shirt fits as expected,
"it is needed as a uniform for work, so we will see how it holds up after a few washes",
"the royal blue color is vibrant, overall a very nice shirt for the money",
i ordered an xl and it fit perfect,
very comfortable,
nothing thus far to dislike,
love it,
comfortable these about the best work pants i've ever had i'm probably going to buy 5 more,
bigger than size orderec,
looks nice on though,
good shirt,
fits as expected,
have purchased several of these shirts in various colors  all fit well and the color and fabric are holding up after numerous washes,
will likely buy more next spring,
what a great value good fit great fabric,
great for the price,
great price for the  shirt,
the polos were very comfortable and didn't expect it to be this good for the price offered,
good stuff,
perfect fit,
jerzees are my go to t shirt or polo,
fit perfect everytime,
el size esta bien,
material feel fine fit perfectly thanks,
nice color,
good sizing,
material is thin and seems cheap,
somewhat small for a medium,
"just what i was looking for, price makes it great",
beautiful on and great quality,
bought 3 of these for my son,
he uses them as his uniform working in a grocery store,
so far they are holding up very well after multiple washings,
material seems to somewhat resist stains as well,
my son loves them,
terrific value for a good look and fit,
i bought eight different colors of the jerzees polo shirts in size large for under $7,
00 each and free shipping,
"that's an amazing value for shirts that look good and fit well, and have beautiful colors",
"i found the black, j navy, maroon and forest green colors to be especially striking and true",
it's often hard to find such good colors in less expensive shirts,
"for example, deep purple is often passed off by manufacturers as black,",
but the jerzees black is a very true black,
"in general, these shirts are somewhat thin, so would be ideal in warmer weather",
"the amazon online prices vary widely by color, currently between $6 and $19, with most having free shipping",
the differences in price may be seasonal or based on availability of each color,
some i paid less than $7 for in february are now $18,
"99, including black and maroon",
"however, even the higher prices aren't bad for these shirts",
"love the shirt, wearing it now 😀",
great fit and very comfortable,
my husband uses these for work,
"once we found these, he doesn't want any others",
wash well and do not shrink,
very comfortable will be buying more,
good quality,
not what i was hoping for,
felt like a “tall” fit,
xl had a long body,
needed a particular color for a “ one time event”,
product performed as expected for a reasonable price,
big ol gillian shirt for my gillian’s island party,
good quality,
just what i wanted,
beautiful shirt,
but came apart under the arms after first wash so is useless,
i didn't like this because i chose it and several other shirts in a large and i ended up with extra larges,
i like the wight of these shirts and they wash well,
everything was ok except the sleeves length almost 2 inches longer than i expected,
did not,
did not like this shirt,
good shirt,
held up better than the kohl's brand,
these are good shirts,
they're well made and wash well,
exactly what i needed for my new job,
poorly two small didn't meet the size it was made like,
in happy send larger size please,
fits nice as expected,
great,
muy buenas,
great for the winter,
"decent, average polo shirt",
great shirts worked perfectly for the summer,
large and rough feeling,
xl felts like a 2xl,
arrived on time,
size was right on,
love them,
"a little thinner than a name-brand polo shirt,",
but the price is right,
i use as weekly wardrobe,
"exactly as described, and nice quality",
"arrived very quickly, within a day or two",
very impressive,
easy to shop site,
very good prices for the quality and customer service,
i would rate this company as high as possible,
can't find better,
"for the $, not too bad",
i was looking for something a little more professional looking,
this polo shirt is soft and lightweight keeps its color after washing better than other brands that i have bought,
for the price i was scared they weren't going to be quality,
but they are feel great look great and priced right love them,
good value for the price point,
not much to say fairly nice shirts,
"no complaints, nice product",
i like it wearing it on the ranch,
surprise it was a very nice shirt for the price dad was super happy with it and put it on right away,
fits great,
looks and feels great too,
will definitely buy more,
"i am 6'3"" and need loong sleeves",
these shirts do the trick,
tried one and then ordered 3 more,
perfit size and price,
awful quality,
great shirt for my daughters  school uniform,
true to size and good value,
fit nicely- comfortable,
very thin,
not happy,
happy with product,
buena tela y tamaño esperado,
"the color sent was labeled royal blue,",
but is actually navy blue,
good fit,
this is a great shirt,
the fit is just right for me -- not tight,
the material is classy,
i've ordered more,
baggy in the arms,
great shirt it your a  heavy weight like myself,
does not make you look pregnant,
"as per my other half, the shirt fit ok, it's a shirt",
not as good looking as in the online photos,
product is great,
super soft and comfortable,
they do run a bit big,
i’m a big guy,
i normally wear a 4xl,
this shirt i could get away with a 3xl,
i bought this as a gift for my husband,
"great fit, came on time,  was asked if there were more",
we will be purchasing a second or third in other colors,
the product arrived on time,
the quality was a good style just ran a lil small,
my nephew needed a white collared shirt for work and this was perfect,
fits great,
very comfortable,
can't be beat at this price point,
great shirt at a great price,
"way to small, i got a 5xl for my father and it was basically a 2xl",
"so if you're a guy ""with more to love"" look elsewhere",
"a little on the short side, other than that, great value",
very nice looking shirt,
i have received many compliments,
shirt was shorter than expected,
but then again they usually are have a hard time finding shirts that are long,
does not fit as expected,
no me agrado la mala calidad del producto,
i ordered a size medium for a woman and it fits well,
but for a man it would be somewhat small,
i also thought the material would be a little bit heavier,
but all in all i still like the shirt,
gave as a gift,
looks great,
nice,
fits good looks good and most importantly it washes up good,
have thrown in dryer on permanent press and it hasn't shrunk,
very nice for work,
i plan on purchasing a few more since my work uniform calls for beige slacks and navy colored polo,
one wash and boy they were super wrinkled and they are cut small so they fit snug,
i suggest you get one size bigger then what you normal wear,
bought this for my boyfriend and it was a good quality shirt and the fit was perfect oh he’s 6’3 so it was long enough as well,
when i put on the jerzees 437 5,
"6 oz 50/50 jersey polo with spotshield-x-large-j navy shirt, i can actually smell the salt of an ocean breeze wafting through my living room",
it made me feel invincible,
"it was only later that i discovered that the windows were open and i live near the the water,",
but man,
this shirt makes you feel like it could do that all on its own,
great polos for an inexpensive price,
these are really thin shirts—almost see-through,
it’s just a long sleeve,
kinda thin,
but not exaggeratedly thin it keeps you at a good temperature i did get it oversized though,
looks good and washes great,
good price and pretty decent shirt,
"it's not as breathable as i would like it to be,",
but that is to be expected from a synthetic blend,
"if you are working in the hot sun go with cotton, if you are not this would be perfect",
loved the shirts,
they were exactly as described,
received them in a timely fashion,
i loved fast shipping and great value,
seems to be good quality so far,
love the color and the size fit really well,
it shrunk very little after the first washing,
it's pretty nice quality and the price can't be beat,
i will definitely buy more,
"the flimsiest, sackiest, scratchiest shirt i've ever purchased",
due to the poor fabric quality it's not even good for rags,
excellent quality and fit for the price,
this shirt was a work purchase,
"well made, happy with color and texture",
"beautiful color green, looks just like picture",
got it for my brother-in-law for christmas,
collar is way too big,
looks ridiculous,
the sleeves are too long too,
fits well,
just not as loose as i wanted,
very nice fit and looks great with dress pants and jeans,
great for my husband's job,
these shirts look very nice and so far wash well,
the price was just too good to be true,
but i ordered thinking even if he only wears them a couple of times it would be worth it,
looks like i made a very good investment,
great fabric weight and technology,
ordered for halloween costume,
works great,
fits well,
it's a very nice shirt it's very fine nice price would buy again,
"material and quality are great, bought 2 for my son",
concerned about washing and putting in the dryer,
may shrink too mcuh,
"the fit and material are much better, and it is much more affordable than similar shirts i bought from a big name catalog store",
the green color of the shirt is much brighter than the image,
fit as described,
nice product,
wears and washes well,
quality item,
good solid product,
wears well and the price is more than a bargain,
i recommend this seller and product,
i like this polo shirt and it was exactly what i wanted,
shirt was very long,
expect to be tucked in,
product met all my sons needs,
"good fit, great quality, can't beat it for the price",
"like the shirt,sporty casual for summer",
a bit tight in the arms,
washed 3 times now,
"cold, gentle cycle",
still shrunk a small bit,
material is too polyester for me,
will not buy again,
i will be buying the other colors as well,
thanks,
poor quality,
does not look as good as on the picture,
and also runs way too small,
gift item and he liked it,
i come back every year,
"great product, price and fit",
"maybe somewhat smallish for a large,",
but it fit me just fine,
"nice shirt, good price",
good product for the price,
he likes the comfort,
i loved the color and quality,
purchased as a gift for dad,
loves the look and feel,
shirt fit is true to size,
great value,
nice shirt -,
but fits a little tight,
great shirt,
you can't beat it for the price,
comfortable and smart,
it is,
however just a little small in size,
it fits ok,
but is a tad smaller than all my other golf shirts and i wonder how it will be when it has been washed a couple of times,
the white shirt arrived with stains and i tried to treat them,
but it is still stained and i guess i have to wear it due to time constraints,
can you at least credit my account?,
great product,
fits well good price and good quality,
looks great,
washes well,
i bought these in several colors,
good quality good fit,
i am particular about red polo shirts and the ones i've seen in stores so i wasn't certain how this would appear and feel,
"thus far, i've worn it several times and washed it many more times and the color is sharp and the shirt feels great",
i like these shirts,
i think i will order more in a different color,
the color was brilliant and bold,
many compliments,
unable to say anything negative,
very nice fit,
very nice quality,
looks sharp,
well made,
these shirts fit great  and are vert comfortable i would highly reccomend tthem,
straight cut and very large,
my husband is a medium and this could fit a very large man,
love these shirts for my son,
"he has to wear them for school and is in men’s sizes, so i have a hard time finding the in the stores, in this material",
great quality,
i will be buying them  again,
"fit well,  great color , fabric felt good 's thick",
good quality,
"nice material,  nice fit",
"i have bought 2 so far , i will buy more for sure",
"fits too large, will not buy again",
"fits well, washes well and little or no shrinkage",
nice looking garment with a modest price,
i ordered a navy first and liked it so well i ordered it in black,
feel good and durable,
great shirt,
it does fit my son really well,
husband loves them,
color was nice as i expected perfect in size aswell,
what i needed,
"very nice, well fitting shirt",
he likes it,
"doesn't love it,",
but likes it,
"looks great, fits great",
this item fit well except for my forearms where it is very tight,
perfect size,
"love this shirt, perfect for my work",
i got a size small and i weigh 150 pounds and i’m 5’ 5’’,
great quality at an amazing low price,
very lightweight,
fits well,
bought these to wear when splitting wood and mowing in the sunshine,
very comfortable,
not sure about shrinkage yet,
bought as a gift for my so,
he likes the fit and feel,
it was a good price and he wears it,
shirt package was marked wrong,
returned package,
son loved it,
fit well and he liked it,
nice look nice in winter time,
very nice,
bought a second time because i loved them so much the first time i had to buy more,
"the sleeves are a bit on the long side,",
but no real complain there,
perfect length and baggy enough to be appropriate,
very comfortable and didn't shrink much after being washed,
great quality and fit,
awesome polo shirt it perfect i like them big not to tight so comfortable,
will be buying more for my grandfather,
he absolutely loves them,
nice shirt,
this shirt is a little bigger and longer than expected,
the shade of color is not the same as on the picture,
it’s actually more of a greenish bluish color,
"overall, it’s a great shirt and you get what you paid for",
water repellent for outside work and they dont shrink in the wash,
"shirts are very nice,",
but much smaller than most shirts this size,
"nice price also, just really watch sizing",
quality not great,
good shirts for the price,
bought 5 different colours for my husband and they were good except the brighter colours like red and purple they started fading after a few wash,
overall ok enough shirts,
i am a xl size and got the larger version because of arm length,
"this fits in the arm perfect for me, and i will have the sides taken in so it is not too big in the stomach",
thin,
but good for price,
perfect,
warm layer for cold seasons,
"my 2nd time ordering this product, and i will order it again",
very good and comfortable shirt,
nice shirt,
this shirt feels and fits great,
i would buy more,
great quality,
great fit great value,
"this polo is a nice, high quality, good fitting polo for a great price",
the only drawback is it seems to fit a little slim,
"overall, a great choice for the unofficial ""it"" uniform of jeans and a polo shirt",
don't forget the flash drive,
love the shirts,
i bought several,
nice style,
i liked everything,
warm shirt for the chilly weather,
returned,
i hate the fabric and overall feeling if this shirt,
the shirts fit well and look nice,
"my only complaint is i bought two shirts supposedly the same except different colors,",
but one was tagless and one was not,
great product,
fast shipper,
great color,
great feel,
very comfortable,
excellent,
good quality for the price,
it fit excellent,
i'll buy this brand again,
i ordered extra large,
the cuffs and forearm seem tight,
but the rest of the shirt including armholes is plenty large,
the material resists water and dirt stains as advertised,
you get what you pay for,
everything was fine and it was a birthday present,
i love the way it  fits  and feels,
loved color,
my favorite,
nice inexpensive polo,
nice shirts for the price,
wear to work,
looks great,
very comfortable,
too large,
customer service bad,
good quality,
white po,
"o are uniforms for me, worn every day, and most get holes in the plackets quickly and the collars curl, or just wear out quick",
i think these will wear well,
yet to be seen and they are very comfortable,
product received promptly and in good order,
i like it and expect to be a repeat customer for this product,
thanx,
great material,
"quick delivery, just really slim even for a tall",
good price,
but a little thin,
will need to wear an undershirt,
"i work in the specialty coffee retailer industry and i have bought jerzees' tees in several occasions in the past, unfortunately they don't provide long sleeve polo shirts for women, so i decided to adventure myself buying these ones",
regrettably the man's  xl long sleeve polo shirt is way too big for me - i decided to gift them to a friend,
i like the quality of the product and the cost of it,
brother liked the color,
i bought these shirts for casual business attire and received nothing,
but compliments on the wide array of colors,
"they fit well, wash well, and i would recommend this to anyone looking for quality casual business wear",
the shirt is good quality and fits very good,
the seller was very helpful and easy to deal with,
i thought it would be a heavier weight,
but it is still a very good buy,
i like these shirts,
"shirt fine,",
but after first washing and dryer shirt was evenly covered with black dots about 1”,
apart,
while all other items cleaned normally,
"fits, washed, and looks well",
great value,
it fit,
confortable,
fit as expected even after a wash and dry,
i would definitely recommend this brand shirt,
"good quality,  wrinkle free and comfortable",
i bought this shirt for travel,
it rolled up small in my bag,
but shook out nicely for wear,
"it is light weight, more than a rugby shirt",
but was perfect with a t-shirt under it even in cool weather,
nice material,
"fit good,",
but a little longer than i thought they would be,
the color was too bright for me,
i gave it to someone else who is happy with it,
nice quality shirts,
my son loves them for school,
"perfect fit, as hoped",
i am 305 lbs,
"6' 2""",
a 'bit' heavy,
it fits as good as any shirt i own,
it is not a 2xl rebranded as a 3xl,
love these shirts i work for dollartree and there perfect,
"purchased for a friend,",
but was unable to wear them,
items were too large,
i needed the shirts to complete my uniform for work,
and it did just that,
thanks jerzees,
great quality &amp,
fit &amp,
value,
"good quality, nice fabric,",
but 3x was very large,
looks great,
"the picture showed white on the bottom of the sleeves and the bottom of the shirt, would have looked nicer with the white that's what i ordered",
great shirt,
it looks good and the fabric is a nice weight - not too heavy or too thin,
"i'm 5'10'', 160 lbs, a medium fit well",
i got a couple in black and a couple in navy blue,
"love the price, fast shipping and comfortable shirt",
color accurate and nicely made,
doesn't look like as pictured,
i guess you get what you pay for,
"cheap thin material, too baggy",
decent shirt,
fit well and didn't shrink when washed on cold,
i have had that happen,
"anyways, good price fits well",
no complaints,
i gave to someone as a gift,
"fits fine, very flimsy for long-term wear",
i'll probably look elsewhere,
the collar is laughable,
the shirts were as i expected,
the quality was consistent with this type of shirt,
the one thing i would mention is the sleeves run very long,
great item,
good,
comfy cotton,
great shirts,
"not to thick, not to thin",
very comfy and fits me perfect,
i work in homes and needed a shirt that didn't ride up showing my gut to the clients,
"5'10"" 230 lbs wearing an x-large shirt",
keeps my belly hidden,
thumbs up,
there is no quality to this shirt,
looks good the color is nice and rich,
holds up well when washed,
what i was expecting,
great shoes,
fades fast,
nice shirt,
perfect shade of green,
they sure are wonderful they are the perfect color for worth they have a very good feel to them theywash well and dry  without shrinking orfading,
they fit well they are true to color in their eyes in a timely manner,
my husband wears them everyday for work,
i haven't heard any complaints yet,
"for the price, there good shirts",
fit as prescribed,
nice quality,
"perfect for when you have to look decent,",
but not great  [ work ],
i like the shirt,
my kid use the shirt for school,
"i like these shirts, they are dirt cheap, super comfortable, and come in a variety of colors",
i use it as a quick shirt to work in,
it is cotton and not too thick,
just right,
will be buying some other colors soon,
very unhappy with product,
one shirt came ripped in the back,
unfortunately my embroider put our logo on it before realizing it,
fits as expected,
love it,
nice shirt,
got this shirt for my son for school,
it looked and felt fine,
basic polo for a good price,
good color &amp,
nice fit,
thanks for the shirts,
they were for my child,
and you'll know how picky teenagers are,
they were just right,
"nice shirt, comfortable wearing shirt",
great product,
fit well,
color as described,
comfortable,
quality quite good for the price,
you can't beat the price,
but the fabric and rail thin and feels and looks cheap,
i would not recommend,
i'm 5'9 and 185 with a 34 inch wait and 36 chest,
i bought the medium and it fits fine,
fit as expected,
perfectly,
color as described,
shirt fit great and looks perfect,
"i wore this item for work, and it was perfect",
slightly big,
"since i forgot it was a men's size, not woman's",
but still perfect for work or just wearing in general,
comfy and warm,
"thin see through material, wore it once and there’s lint balls all over the arms and sides",
washes well with no shrinkage,
very comfortable material,
i love this shirt i already have two shirts that i bought two years ago for a previous job i was at,
and i thought that it was so comfortable so i bought two more,
but for my new job,
thinner than i expected,
good work shirt,
holds up well after washing and feels comfortable all day,
just right,
"fit great, don't fade, no knots",
nice shirt,
"great quality, price, and fast shipping",
nothing to complain about,
nice weight of fabric for work uniform,
"runs a little large,and long",
fits great,
👍👍,
great product bought 3 of them in different colors and for price can't beat them,
"great, basic work shirts",
not the highest quality,
but definitely not bad,
very light woven material,
good color,
"scholl dress code, my son will not wear the shirt",
great fit i like them a lot,
well made and comfortable material,
get what you pay for,
surprising good shirt for the price you pay,
i would not wear it to go out,
but perfect for a casual sunday,
very long sleeves and long shirt comparing with a small size shirt,
very happy with this product,
nice lightweight polo shirt,
perfect for wearing to work,
the material isn’t super thick,
nice quality,
very comfortable shirt and washes well,
the shirt was as expected for the price,
but nothing special about this particular brand,
do not buy this,
the fabric is itchy,
for the price it is a good value,
fit great and seams to be built well,
pun intended,
very good shirt for the price,
i would recommend this as a good purchase,
great shirt for the price,
i would recommend &amp,
buy again,
love the material,
"the fabric is light, perfect for summer",
good buy if u work at dollar tree,
"fit well, kinda thin",
"classic, simple, and straightforward",
the shirt fabric was thin and see through,
i prefer a thicker fabric,
material is a bit more thin than i thought,
but will work great for layering,
good price and great quality,
material is thinner,
but that is what i was looking for,
definitely well wor,
the price,
"then again, i like my clothes a little baggy",
just as described and fast shipping,
it looks like 100 % cotton  and very ordinary quality product,
dont get cheated by picture in the website,
gift,
like,
beautiful shade of green,
it is thinner fabric than i expected,
good shirt for price,
"cool x hot temperature, like it more than the gray",
i bought two shirts for my husband for work and that fit really well,
"as described, thin",
very thin,
great shirt for the price,
feels good and is a good fit,
could be better fabric,
"it fit small, so i gave it awy",
great fit and true color,
fit was as expected,
this was absolute cheapest fabric and was not even worth $7,
think of a uniform shirt from your favorite fast food joint and this shirt was worse than that,
don't buy,
i like  my shirt fits good well,
"super comfortable, great price im a happy customer",
siiii,
"nice, fit comfortably",
i ordered this polo to serve as nice shirt i could wear on dress down day at the office,
it fits perfectly and the color has stayed beautiful through several washes,
very happy wtih the product,
will buy more,
great for the price,
great shirt for the price,
real value for the price,
not crazy about this one,
material not what i expected,
but at the price it’s ok,
i got this for my dad and it fits him perfectly,
the material is good and no problem after washing it even few times now,
he really like it and so far no problem with this,
wouldn't buy again,
only keeping it because it didn't cost much,
not sure i'll ever wear it,
as expected,
more for cold climate,
i got this shirt and another for my husband for christmas and they fit him perfect,
i love them on him,
buenísimo,
"great product, great supplier",
thank you,
i like that the sleaves are a little longer,
some polo shirts it seems like they are trying too save money by making the sleaves as short as possible,
these are great for work,
great shirt for the price,
good shirt for the price,
it was just a little smaller than expected,
but it fits with a small amount of space,
problem may come post wash if it shrinks some with it being a percentage cotton,
"soft, fits well and it is comfortable",
washes well and looks great,
to right and very itchy,
the material fills like a cheap t-shirt and can’t get the lines from being folded out even after washing and drying a few times,
tried  ironing to see if the lines would go away and still didn’t,
i absolutely love this shirt,
this was exactly what i was looking for and fits so perfectly,
i will definitely be buying some more of these,
i bought these for my husband to wear to work in the summer,
"he loves these shirts because they are long enough to tuck into his pants, and stay there",
they wear well and don't shrink when washed,
a great shirt for the price,
"very vivid color, boyfriend liked the cut",
perfect fit,
"the color is good and the fit is fine, although i would have like it to be a little longer",
"it fits great, doesn't absorb sweat and doesn't have a funny smell after a long day of work",
i would know i'm a janitor at arizona mill mall and i have to deal with all sorts of chemicals and other liquids,
the only problem i had was keeping it tucked in,
i do wonder if its available in bigger sizes than 4xl cause i saw a xxxxx size and i'm not sure if its a kids 5x or adults,
it's to big,
the size chart is incorrect,
it came with a hole,
this is my 5th jerzees polo shirt,
they all fit well and are comfortable,
the color is still like new even after many washes,
true to size,
good quality,
just right,
good quality for price,
excellent buy,
fits as expected,
my boyfriend is a medium and the medium fits perfectly,
great fit and price,
it is made well,
but it does fit a little bit small so whatever size you normally wear be on the safe side and order one size up,
product runs about 1 size smaller than expected,
like the style &amp,
color-saving it for an occasion,
nice shirt,
"the xl seemed a little more like an l,",
but good enough,
nice shirt,
"the quality of the product is great, i ordered a large which was a little baggy,",
but not excessively,
nice work shirt,
the texturevof it and length,
after two washes,
the seams started getting loose,
"this is a nice, well-made product",
bought this for my father,
"he has always been pretty picky on clothes, and likes to dress well",
he loved it,
made with fairly good cotton and the old traditional cut,
perfect fit,
gift,
nice shirt nice price,
fits well,
too big,
pretty good shirts,
but a little big,
"i don't think you have to go one size down, though",
no issues,
shirts fit well,
they look decent,
i run a restaurant and ruin my clothes all the time,
"at five bucks a piece, i can wear something nicer than a t-shirt and not worry if it gets trashed",
not the greatest shirts in the world,
but worth the money,
great fit,
comfortable,
lfits ok,
arms are a bit tight,
ite will do fine,
nice and soft,
the shirts fit great my husband was a very happy man,
good golf shirts wish you had more colors,
not the super best style,
i needed black polos for work and to get dirty in and these work out,
"fast shipping,",
but it runs big,
"all my boyfriend's shirts are all large,  that's what he wears,",
but this one the sleeves are so long,
it is more like a xl than a l,
nice shirt,
"yo la compre para el verano, y es muy caliente",
buy one size larger as it shrunk after wash,
"nice weigh, well made, good fit, and good quality",
shrunk after 1st wash,
okay only,
"i have trouble finding shirts that fit me the way i like, these fit me perfectly",
i ordered more at this price,
bueba compra,
pretty comfortable shirt,
good fit,
love it,
", i'm med",
this is a large,
period i'm 57 160,
this shirt was just as expected,
i've worn it dozens of times and washed it just as many,
the color hasn't really faded overall,
fits true to size and is worth the money,
la tela da mucha calor y me quedo grande,
fits nicely,
just as expected,
i like the color,
my husband love’s his shirt,
just ordered 5 more in different colors,
he is a 3x and is very picky with his clothes,
it feels so good finding something he likes 🤗,
"great shirt, good quality and a great price",
it was good,
as stated on my other review about this same shirt,
"it is a nice fit, hasn't faded with washing",
one of my son's favorite shirts,
looks good,
not high quality material,
a good product that is light and comfortable to wear,
"it does run a bit small, and has gotten slightly smaller with each wash",
"overall, it is worth the money, and look very stylish",
it fits,
my dad loves them,
he has one in every color,
these are exactly what i needed for work,
the fit is great,
"i ordered a medium and they're slightly roomy, very comfy",
", and the material is a little thinner than on most polos, which is what i wanted since i work around ovens all day and it gets really warm",
i'm thinking of getting a couple more of these in other colors too,
great buy,
too hot in florida these days to wear them,
great color and great fit,
this shirt fits and feels good,
great product at an unbelievable price,
great material,
feels comfortable,
item as described,
prompt delivery,

shabby material,
i know that amazon,
com does not sell everything you need in life,
but they come darn close,
i bought 2 polo style shirts for me &amp,
my husband,
i coordinate a c,
community emergency response team,
"being a leader, i need to look as nice as i can when i am meeting new members, local elected officials, and other related ""cert"" business",
"the shirts are a great quality, very reasonably priced and i am never disapointed in amazon",
"from gifts to gadgets, amazon is the place i go",
thanks for all you do,
comfortable and looks good,
my son is about 6 foot and prefers the tighter cut of a medium,
this fit fine,
but was by no means fitted or tight,
maybe not quite a full size,
difference,
but certainly a little larger,
the fabric is nice though and it washes well,
nice shirt for price,
very nice,
better than expected,
on time and it fits well,
already knew what to expect as i had bought the green one before,
it's exactly as expected,
i am 6 ft 2 inches tall and weigh 170 and the small fits perfectly,
worked great for my children's school uniforms,
was oversized,
but that’s how i wanted it,
great product as expected,
ok short,
could be wider in the torso,
"nice fit, soft, comfortable, and at a good price",
good product,
these shirts fit nice even after washing and drying,
this is my second time buying this brand,
fabric is ok,
fits very nicely,
washes up great,
i would recommend this shirt to anyone,
the t-shirt is looking good,
but is was too large for me,
got a variety of colors,
the collar is floppy,
great purchase,
fit perfectly so i am buying more of these in different colors,
it's ok,
i expected better,
great fit,
yes,
very good fit,
lovely polo for a very good price,
recommend,
fits great,
very comfortable,
i have spent years and countless dollars looking for a fitted shirt to fit,
"im 6'2"" and weigh 195lbs",
"not muscular, just tall and thin",
everything thus far has been like a blouse and it drives me nuts,
"these shirts fit great and because they are a cotton/poly blend, dont show sweat as much and dry so fast",
who knew an $8 shirt would be so nice,
standard good weight double knit material,
good value for the dollar,
"not the best shirt,",
but very low price,
"so, all in all a good deal any time",
"casual and one step up form a ""t"" shirt",
"nice fit, good value",
too big not as advertised,
i received the item 4 days before it was intended to be delivered,
exactly what i needed,
good light weight golf shirt,
very light weight and silky felling will be great on warm summer day,
great color good sticking,
seems to be week made for the excellent price,
time and wearing will tell,
great shirts for the price,
"a little bit thin and see through,",
"but otherwise, very good bang for the buck",
another thing i like is that they don't get the hanger marks on the shoulder area like some of my polos do,
i have to wear white polos to work and these are pretty damn nice for the price,
better than the craft and barrow cheapie shirts at kohl's and less than half the price,
i might just buy a few more of these,
nice material,
good,
very nice pro,
fit perfectly can’t complain,
both the body length and sleeves are long enough,
"i wear a 34/35 sleeve and am 6'-2""",
excelente,
shirts fit well and do good against staining,
this shirt is perfect,
it is a good length and size,
nice soft shirt,
fit really well,
greatprice,
pretty good looking shirt for the price,
"a great golf shirt, well made and an amazing price",
the shirt shrunk after first wash,
i have only had it about 10 weeks and use it once a week for work,
after 10 weeks it looks old and the material is snagging,
i really like this jerzees polo type long sleeve shirt,
very warm and comfortable,
i bought a navy blue and red one,
perfect fit,
fit great and i'll get another one soon,
"nice shirt, fits well",
"this shirt is very easy to wash, dries wrinkle free and is very comfortable",
i thought this product was pre shrunk,
but it wasn’t it still strank,
"brought for a relative, she wore it well",
fit good,
first time buying clothes off amazon,
#satisfied,
"ordered the 4xl, it fits more like a 3xl",
but the length is 4xl,
comfortable enough,
but i think material is just a little too thin,
overall it's i can't complain too much when you consider the price,
good if you're using it for work,
grear quality for the price,
the sleeves are really big,
dislike the material,
ok for the money,
thought i would give it a try,
doubt i'll buy another one,
please be aware that this item is not returnable,
"i ordered a large, which should fit, and it was so big and baggy",
now i’m stuck with it,
very good,
great fro price,
thumbs up,
price is good,
i ordered a couple of these for my brother who needs a polo-type open neck,
he loves these jerseys,
"they fit perfectly, launder well, and are very attractive",
nice fit comfortable shirt,
"however, it’s basically a t-shirt with a collar sewed on to it",
good fit not tight and just what i was looking for,
my guy loved the shirt and thought that it fit well and was a great breathable material,
really comfortable and good looking,
great fit,

the price and shirt  looks very nice,
good quality,
heavier than expected,
nice fit,
arms are long and i have long arms???,
good quality,
true to size,
really love the fit of these,
super comfy shirts now that i know the size fits i’ll definitely be purchasing more,
i really like how these fit as they have longer sleeves than most polos,
the price makes them great for work shirts too,
good product,
just what we needed for uniforms at school,
my husband loves the fit,
washes and dries very nice without shrinkage,
i recently bought two of these shirts,
the turquoise shirt had a tear under the armpit after less than a month,
the grey shirt is good so far,
as advertised,
it's was alright,
i've bought their short sleeve shirts before so i knew what to expect,
washed it in cold water dried it in storage room,
warmish,
but air-dried and it fits slightly better,
perfect thank you,
waaay too big,
boxy,
2 thumbs up on price and quality,
"good fitting shirt, great price",
excellent materials and workmanship,
"so far, they've withstood the effects often caused by repeated washings",
"if this continues, i'll be buying more of them",
nice shirt for the price,
fits perfect for my son,
comfortable like a t-shirt,
just wore them and they are in the washing machine,
looking forward to wearing them this week,
mala calidad,
comfortable,
i have several colors,
they seem to hold up well through several washes,
will purchase more,
"a-ok, i like it for cool weather",
these are decent inexpensive shirts,
they are pretty thin though,
i guess thats why they are el cheapo priced,
nice shirt for the money,
the cotton is so thin you only get three washings before you can see through the material,
good value,
nice casual shirt,
"great product, thanks",
runs big,
but overall very comfortable,
my husband loves theses shirts,
nice shirts for price  fit was just rite they were  for my for work,
"very nice, thank you",
"shirt was correct size, roomy and lightweight",
nice color,
fits well and my son seems to like these jersey polos,
great color great shirt,
the price and quality is great for those in the big and tall category,
material cheap,
i'm small framed and the shirt fit me well,
"good value for a good looking, we'll fitting shirt",
also has good sleeve length,
shirts fit well and don't fade,
i like it,
i'm a 2x and it fit perfectly,
not too big or too small,
i've washed it once and it didn't shrink,
nice looking causal shirt to wear with jeans,
"buenisimo articulo ,tanto como la calidad de la tela y confeccion bueno ,recomendable",
"i was looking for ""bargain""garments for travel",
got what i was looking for,
itchy cheap material,
great fit,
good quality shirt,
value priced,
i like this shirt,
it's a medium weight shirt and it comes out of the dryer wrinkle free,
i will be ordering more,
"good shirt,",
but is shrinking wash by wash,
very satisfied,
"not the most luxurious fabric,",
but i didn't expect that for the money,
great for casual wear,
washed it once so far and seems to have held up nicely,
great quality and fit,
shirt is falling apart,
started happening right after return date,
buying this brand is a waste of money,
"i ordered red, black, and navy",
after many washes they haven't faded,
they have held their color better than the more expensive chaps brand that i used to buy which faded after only a couple of washes,
"the material and color-fastness are not as good as i had hoped,",
but it fits well and should last,
nice shirt,
hasn't shrunk or faded,
what a difference a collar makes for classiness,
good work shirt for the money,
perfect uniform shirt,
good price,
great deal fit fine,
perfect,
i’ve bought 8 of them,
but in different colors,
the white ones make great boating/fishing shirts,
will definitely buy more,
uncomfortable material,
love this shirt,
was a little smaller than expected based on their sizing chart,
this is really just t-shirt material,
and not even soft,
with a decent collar attached,
that's why it was so inexpensive,
not really a polo type shirt at all,
i like the fit and look of the shirt,
la tela esta muy bien pero es demasiado grande para la talla que dice ser,
"i have never written clothing review before,",
"but i will say, they are the absolute best shirts you can buy for the price",
"true fit, may be a little too baggy before first wash",
"if the color continues to stay, i will buy the rest of them",
"i was confused by all the negative reviews,",
but i took a chance and i got some pretty solid shirts,
"i have black, purple, and navy",
i will probably be ordering the rest of the colors,
nice shirt for great price,
use the shirts for work,
great fit,
great shirt,
very comfortable,
a great shirt and it just as was described,
perfect fit and quality,
i will buy more for sure,

great,
"great for work, i will order more colors",
very nice and soft febric only one thing length is to big,
nice fit,
"slightly thinner material than what i expected,",
but otherwise well made,
great shirt and great price,
mom got this for my future husband and he loves it,
he is a big and tall guy and it fits perfectly,
good color nice material,
"large color selection , comfortable fabric ,i plan on ordering more",
fits somewhat larger than expected,
"i'm stand roughly 6 foot 3 inches and weigh around 100 kg, plus or minus 5kg",
"fabric is a bit coarse -- not enough to keep me from wearing it,",
but a bit unusual,
"the fabric is nice if you don't like ""shiny"" synthetics",
good value,
it looked okey until my husband tried it on,
the length was good,
but this shirt doesn't streatch as expected for a jerzee,
my husband is medium built and the forearm parts were so tight even when i tried to streatch them as much as possible,
i regret to purchase this,
it was a nice and comfy shirt,
right size,
very nice shirt,
it fits horrible,
i like  wearing it work and it is comfortable to wear,
good quality,
but more bigger as expected,
product is expected quality and shipping was fast,
a new favorite,
very small and does not fit,
"you get what you pay for, great shirt for golf and tennis,",
but not great for work dinner,
served well,
perfect fit and comfortable,
sleeves were so long it looked goofy,
the sleves were a little longer than expected,
quality of the shirt was good,
they are nice shirts,
soft material washes well,
"this shirt is so nasty, it looks really good",
the sleeves fit nice and tight and arent baggy,
great shirt for the price,
"i always have a problem with shirts shrinking after i think i find one that fits well,",
but this one has not shrunk at all,
has stood up to weekly wear for at least six months so far,
love these shirts long lasting great fit,

"after the first, i bought two more",
great fit and price,
soft,
comfortable,
nice look for my business,
good price,
great fit,
nice and tight on the arms and chest which i like,
the shirt is good quality,
fit is as expected,
and it arrived in perfect condition within four days of my order,
great fit and not too hot,
good decent collar shirt that does the job,
i'm a bigger person and this shirt fit me perfectly,
"the material is exactly as described, this shirt is very light and breaths well",
great fit,
good,
good,
"no me agrado el productono tiene calidad ,cuando lo fui a devolver me quieren cobrar lo mas caro que lo que me costo de verdad son una estafa",
perfect fit for my husband and they are such good quality for the price-will order this again,
material is super thin and see through and seller wants me to pay to return,
really unhappy,
jerzees are a brand i always thought was good as well as durable,
these shirts are great and came at a great price,
good quality with a good price tag,
what could be better?,
the shirts fit as advertised,
not bad for the price,
material is a little thin,
but if you are in hot weather that is not bad,
nice shirt,
second time i've purchased these shirts for work,
the first ones lasted almost a year,
great price for a well-made shirt,
shirt is just great for my hubby,
he likes the fit and it's comfortable,
it was exactly what we were looking for,
relaxed fit,
but size is perfect,
and causal,
can’t beat the price,
a slightly tighter fit than i was used to,
but looks great to this day,
has yet to fade which is awesome,
the sizing is very off,
need to order a few sizes bigger the you normally get,
thinner than expected,
"got several of these for my grandfather, he loves them",
pretty color,
wish it was all cotton,
"good fit, good price",
excellent product,
very thin material and not polo pique knit is more like a jersey knit,
well made,
it fits great,
it's exactly what i was looking for,
"for the price, you cannot go wrong",
good fit and excellent for summer,
"another great quality, good fit",
as usual i have better luck buying these shirts online than in brick &amp,
mortar stores,
price was good and overall quality  consistently high,
it fit well,
"however, the color seemed to fade quickly",
got 3 different colors for my father,
he liked them so much i had to purchase 3 for myself,
fits as expected,
i would purchase more of them if were the same price,
item was 2 big,
used 4 work,
i had ordered a couple xl shirts for gifts and they didn’t fit,
"i ordered these being same size, color, and fabric, and the fit good",
now i will know where to order from now on,
to wear at church,
"love the color, fit and feel of this shirt",
it washes well,
great shirts for the price,
light weight,
comfortable,
washes well,
ironing not needed,
"nice shirt, fit perfect, was glad i ordered a little big",
needed for work and was great,
way to  big,
they need to check there siding,
did not return as they charge for returns,
a loss,
perfect fit,
"cheap polo for the business casual, mostly casual look",
super fast shipping,
so far they have been great shirts,
"light weight,",
but that is what i wanted,
i'm wearing it now and enjoying it,
"shipped fast , came in on time , &amp",
fits like a glove,
poor quality and all shirts after three months have holes in the underarm,
"should have known, given the price",
buyer beware,
muy buen producto,
the shirt fits well it is just a baggy fit,
great for casual wear,
simple and easy to wash,
great price,
no collar tags,
color faded after one wash,
"nice shirt, fits good and very nice fabric",
the color is a little brighter than i expected,
but still looks good,
very nice,
pperfect for work love the fit,
these survived a trip to montreal with no wrinkling,
washes beautifully with no color loss,
"not thick enough, not very good quality",
"excellent jersey for the money, i highly recommend this product, they do run large though",
great value,
still looks good after wash,
"slightly thin,",
but a great price and correct color,
perfect for a school uniform,
comfortable and good for work with a loose fit,
"heavy, wouldn't recommend for golf or hot work conditions",
material was much thinner than expected,
tried to embroider a logo on a shirt and it tore,
very think and weak material,
basically a t-shirt with a collar added on,
fits perfect,
comfortable,
and light,
size is what you get,
great price,
nice shirt for the price,
fits great,
material is a bit scratchy,
great fitting  very durable,
and color doesn't fade when washed,
i really like the color and the way this shirt fits,
i will buy in more colors,
very nice,
exactly what i expected,
great fitting shirt color didn't fade at all after many washes,
"these do seem to run a little on the larger side,",
but they're still a good buy,
material can really take a beating,
good products,
"simple polo, does the job",
it did shrink a little even though i followed the washing directions,
"i expected that, and it wan't bad",
i'd buy again,
not very good product,
came quick and was nice material,
i like the longer sleeves,
muy linda la camiseta quedó a la medida,

this is a decent shirt for casual wear,
fits correctly and keeps it's color after washing,

"the sleeves are long enough for my arms, and the shirt goes below my waistline",
quality,
really nice shirt especially for the price,
my son loved it,
i would definitely recommend this product,
haven't tried it on yet,
but i'm sure it'll fit,
the color isn't too bright although red isn't one of my favorite colors,
but i'm sure it will be appropriate for the occasion,
"sorry,",
"but this 2xl is so long, it's way differently sized from our local stores",
"the shirts are nice, i'm going to ask to replace with the next smaller size",
thank you,
the shirt met our expectations,
the polo is just what i ordered and what i wanted,
fits and looks great,
it is light-weight which i wanted because i live in a tropical climate,
a nice polo shirt,
nice shirt love it,
what i order was small red,
but when i opened it up it was large,
very disappointing,
the blue was fine,
very comfortable shirts will buy again,

they are comfortable affordable and easy to take care of,
nice fit and look,

it fits perfect and very comfortable,
spotshield isn't very effective,
it got dingy and spotted by the 3rd wash,
it is good quality matierial,
very nice shirts,
sent back,
inexpensive for a reason,
"if you have thin arms a thin neck and a huge torso, skip this shirt",
odd fit,
"for the price these are great, plus with prime they are here in 2 days",
washed well he liked them,
not a bad shirt for the money,
the shirts are top quality,
water just beads off,
air flows right through the shirt when wearing,
"bought three more,plus, they have 42 different colors",
this shirt fit as expected,
it did arrived on time and still look in great condition after a few washes,

the arm length is a bit too long,
as advertised,
as advertised,
the tshirt with white paint in the left side,
real good fit,
comfortable,
size xl was a bit small,
fabric faded and lost its smooth appearance after about  6 months of occasional wearing,
perfect and quality,
"i was concerned the first time i ordered one of these shirts,",
however i'm pleased with the look and fit,
hard to beat this shirt for quality at this price,
nice shirt,
fits great,
too big,
"overall a good value,",
but the shirt runs a little large,
we buy these as uniforms,
they are standard weight cotton,
true to the forest green color shown,
i would like if the collars withstood washing a bit better and if they had a pocket,
"otherwise, they are a good value for the money",
stain resistant,
fits great,
fit good i like the way it look on my son,
my son wore this item to school,
great work shirt and has not faded over 5 - 7 washes,
wonderful shirts,
"sent it back, was a little oversize",
order a size bigger cause it shrinks some,
overall great shirt,
love how its delivered fast always,
"good fit, good quality, great price",
"it's a thin, very basic, shirt",
don't expect a lot and you'll be okay with it,

shirt fit as described,
like them,
nice basic shirt,
"just ok,",

nice,
great shirt i bought three and work full time and am very active at work,
"no sweat stains, doesn’t hold dirt",
a great shirt,
i have a few jerzees that i've used to sleep in instead of pj tops so i knew this would be ok as an extra white tennis polo,
like them,
i have two,
for the money,
i needed this color for work,
it was a great color and fit,
was exactly described,
good quality,
fits well,
fits as expected,
medium weight,
feels more like cotton than poly,
nice,
seems to be good quality,
we will see after a few washes,
"for some reason, i can't find this style locally",
"my son needed some shirts dressier than a t-shirt,",
these look very nice and the price is great,
"the fabric is soft, washes well and is comfortable",
"it shrank a very small amount with the first time in the dryer,",
but all shirts with cotton will do that,
it even packs well without wrinkling too much,
the fabric isn't super-thick,
i'd say just right,
bargain,
i'll be buying more,
material thinner than expected,
no problems here,
a quality shirt at a great price,
i ordered 2 of these shirts to wear for work and they are pretty good,
i guess i didn't realize that i don't really care for the cotton poly blend,
next time i will just look for 100% cotton,
snug fit for my size,
i like these shirts because they are longer and don't come untucked,
normal shirt,
fits as expected,
listing says tagless,
my shirts came with tags,
"no shrinkage after drying, fit well",
love the quality and the price is great,
"shirt is cut small and cheaply made, the sleeve arm band curls and doesn't lay flat",
"the material is okay, very thin and somewhat tight on the arm area from bicep to wrist",
it was used as a work shirt,
color was true as seen,
fit well,
and not to thin a material,
"these shirts are an exact match to those worn by the wait staff at the arch diner in brooklyn, where i work",
perfect in every way,
awesome fit and very comfortable,
great quality for price,
"although it fit a little smaller than expected, it is of good material and with stands the washing machine",
"this shirt was  for a relative who works at dollar tree, which is their company color",
"fit as expected, color was great and shipping was on time",
comfortable,
a little tight and short for an x-large,
nothing great,

now i understand why it was more inexpensive than other similar shirts,
awesome shirt,
comfortable and well built,
i will be purchasing more,
they're long,
cheap and thin material,
good polo for everyday and,
"while somewhat small, a full size larger would probably be too large",

the neck is a little short,
but acceptable,
great fit &amp,

comfortable cut and durable,
comfortable,
i ordered 3 of these shirts,
after the first wash the shirts shrunk,
i basically got one use out of them,
great color,
material nice and fits well,
it's a quality breathable shirt for the price,
size accuracy is important to me and it met expectations,
will buy more,
i love these,
i reload every year when the color starts to fade,
100% cotton fades in 4 months,
these are very comfortable and well made shirts for casual wear,
dry nice polo,

great quality,
this was a gift so i can’t answer this,
perfect fit and showed up on time,
"comfortable material,very nice shirt",

i like it,
good quality,

it fit him well and held up in the wash so far,
great shirt for the money,
great experience,
pleased,
great buy for a decent quality polo,
i purchased these shirts for work uniforms for my co-workers and the fabric looks cheap,
lets just say you get exactly what you pay for,
silly me thinking there would be more bang for the buck,
"this shirt is soft ,comfortable and easy to take care of",
fits very well,
medium fits similar to a large lee long sleeve shirt,
take care in wash and dry as this can get old looking fast if you dry on high heat,
looking on my father in law,
nice product,
my first order i never receive,
i order again my second t-shirt and now i received,
my husband is happy with it,
comfortable,
worn as a work uniform,
got this for my fiancee and he looks so good,
definitely buying every color,
awesome fit,

i’m very happy with them,
"quality was not as expected , thought i would find something of better quality",
nice for the price,
"will work for a fall/winter, just hope it doesn't shrink much after washing",
about what i expected,
an inexpensive polo shirt,
very good,
thank you,
great summer shirts,
fits as expected,
like every thing,
it was perfect,
shirts are for work and are the right color and size,
they are nice shirt for the price paid,
they arrived the 10th of february which is good considering our weather,
really happy,
little over priced,
bought these shirts to meet job requirements for employment at a fast growing food chain,
they have held out well over time and hold up well in the wash,
good when a t shirt is not appropriate,
this is a pretty nice shirt,
i bought it for my fiancé who goes through a lot of clothes fast,
"it was a bit large on him, though",
the material is okay for the price,
but the shirt was just way too large,
i had to end up getting an xl in the boys version of this shirt,
didn't shrink into a amoebic size after washing and drying,
bought 3 and i think they are as good as it gets for the price,
nice material weight for florida,
color fast when washed,
well made and good fit,
product fit perfectly,
"great product, price and fast shipping",
i don’t like anything with this clothes,
no,
great product,
great product,
the quality is not good,
these shirts are comfortable,
size,
fits perfectly,
it is good long-sleeve polo shirts for golfing or everyday wearing,
they are great and very reasonably priced,
comfortable fit,
it's like the sewed a collar on a regular t-shirt and called it a polo,
"comfortable, soft, looks good",
pretty much fits well,
can put in the dryer and doesn't shrink,
good uniform shirt and great price,
excellent,
wish it had a pocket,
but otherwise excellent,
does repel stains and looks good,
it's good for the price,
great fitting quality shirt i will buy again,
ordered this item specifically because it was a long sleeve,
i received a short sleeve,
not the item that i paid for,
"the material also feels cheap,",
but in that respect you get what you pay for,
would definitely not order again from this seller,
i love this shirt,
it fits perfect and it is great to wear to work,
the blended fabric just isn't the same as all cotton,
but the price is right,
very large and you can see through fabric,
muy bueno,
i like the fabric,
it seems that will resist stains,
we had them embroidered and it took the embroidery well also,
"fits great, good quality",
for the price it canoot be beat,
the quality is just okay,
this was a very nice gift for my husband,
value 4 money,
it looks great,
it feels great,
i purchased this shirt for leisure wear,
hubby loves it,
my dad is a mechanic and wears polos when he works,
he goes through them all the time i thought this would be perfect and at a great price,
i plan on buying more,
"as described, fit great, comfortable, washed up nice",
these shirts were a very good value for the price,
nice loose fit with just the right thickness of fabric if you want to stay cool,
fits perfect nice &amp,
big,
i’m not one to write bad reviews,
"but this shirt is made out of the same material as a tube sock , also runs big, very big",
needless to say i will be returning the item,
"very comfortable,",
but too big,
good product and comfortable,
it screams wear me,
love the blue,
excellent pricing and comfortable fit,
good solid blue color,
i like the product and i use it for work,
the shirts  look nice and fit nice,
but the material is thin for a long sleeve winter shirt,
this shirt is worth every penny,
i've washed it like 20+ times and it's keeping it's color like day 1,
very soft and comfortable,
fits perfectly and looks great,
my son loves this jersey polo,
the material is soft and comfortable,
it is also a good quality polo,
comfortable polo with no logo's,
product as expected &amp,
quick delivery,
great fit,
washes nicely,
love it,
comfy--,
"however, the color is not as deep black as shown in pic",
nice comfortable fitting/feeling shirt,
i wear them in a professional environment,
ordering 2 more colors,
sizes are really strange,
"i bought the medium, didn’t fit",
"then the large, also didn’t fit",
good quality,
great price,
i have to wear shirts with a collar for work,
i also have to tuck them,
"these shirts stay tucked throughout the day when i raise my arms high, which is often",
all good,
"like the shirts thus far, like the feel",
cheap price,
but not a cheap look,
"great fit, fabric &amp",
colors for daily wear,
well made,
nice color &amp,
quality,
nice,
polo shirts fits well and the quality is what i expected for the price,
too large even the small size,
runs bigger than i thought,
would order again,
great buy,
very happy with the product and seller,
easy wash and wear,
perfect for uniform,
came exactly as expected,
very happy with the fit and this purchase,
got these for work,
"they’re okay, not the best",
i thing wrong with the shirts at all just a little too small for me,
my son loved it,
it fit well,
my daughter was happy,
i love this shirt,
"it's very comfortable, and it's my favorite shirt for work",
the arms were too long for a short sleeve,
too long,
it is certainly a shirt,
they're nice shirts,
"i ordered too big,",
but that's not the manufacturer's fault,
it's a good buy,
i'd reccomend these to friends,
thanks amazon prime,
very cheap material,
great,
great shirt for the price,
"this shirts are good quality, and they are fresh material that feels good for working in the summer",
"however, the sleeves are way too long",
use for work,
if you have to charge more then do it,
but any extra large size can not be thin,
shirt arrived quickly,
"fits good, nice shirt for the price",
too thin,
fabric not good quality,
"great product,",
but it isn't tagless as it was advertised,
soft material,
bargain,
check out similar product,
thus us better,
"i really like this product,",
great quality,
i like that the sleeves go to my elbows,
for my job it fit well lightweight it's comfortable is it a iron,
quality for the price,
fits perfectly,
"purchased this for my son for his job, and he has been very impressed",
very comfortable and durable,
great material and color,
"quality product, size as described, not undersized or mislabled",
good quality for the price,
i bought small for a 14 years old and it fits a little bit large,
fit as it should,
"for the price, yes this gets 5 stars",
it's a good basic polo shirt,
"comfortable, well sized, and the color matched the picture",
i got dark red/maroon,
"i am 5'7"" with a 34 inch waist and the fit is great",
"not baggy, not too tight",
many other brands have a lot of extra material in the mid-section,
this looks more professional and fit just right so if you have a big belly it may be tighter on you,
minimal shrinking after laundering,
there are better brands out there,
but you'll pay much more,
"for this price, i'm getting a few more",
"i'm 5'-9"" and these shirts could be a night gown",
"i guess they assume a person who needs a x-large must be 6'-6"" tall",
"nice quality,for school",
no surprises,
i got exactly what i thought i would get,
minimum shrinkage after 1 wash and 1 dry,
"for work clothes, i highly recommend it",
thanks,
excellent,
recommend,
very good quality,
everything good,
this is a very nice shirts,
light weight and cool,
very reasonably priced,
"i thought it would shrink, my fault for ordering that size",
usually i get all cotton,
i would order again in large,
"good value, and quality",
nice,
this shirt just fits as it should,
hopefully though there will be no shrinkage after the first wash,
happy with this purchase fits well and good quality,
very satisfied with fit and appearance of shirt,
would buy agin,
cheap flimsy material,
not worth the price,
excellent quality shirt,
my wife really loves the way it looks and feels,
washing is risk free and after drying it looks great,
"i will buy again, thank you",
fits great,
"size fit great, good quality product",
this is made out of a tshirt material not a thicker material that you would expect with a polo,
fit well,
"not the best quality,",
but great for the price,
i don't think you'll find this one on the rack at nordstroms,
light summer weight,
but not cheap,
nice,
i really like these long sleeve polos,
fit and look great,
"the product came as expected, fits fine",
"fit, comfort and price",
"the large fits like an xx large,",
but the color was nice,
i request for a refund,
some what a little big,
but still will serve its purpose,
good quality,
"did not know it had spotshield,",
but i like it anyway,
great shirt,
fits and feels great,
wear this for work,
don't put it in the dryer,
great comfortable shirt,
"very pleased with the shirts, i work in physical therapy and this is a perfect shirt to work in, very flexible",
good fit,
very green and very nice shirt for the price,
"in this time of concern, it was nice to not have to go to the store",
thank you,
love material and how it fits,
im a big guy,
need a 2xl,
the shirt fit well except for the collar,
"feels like they put a 16"" collar",
my husband was very pleased with this item,
nice long sleeve jersey shirt with a collar,
"the only thing is the collar tends to flatten down, other than that it's nice",
fits too large,
i wear a medium on most shirts,
occasionally small,
i bought a medium and it felt like large,
looks nice and all just too bad the sizing is a bit off,
comfortable fit,
it's a decent shirt,
came in a small bag,
super fast shipping,
this is a great product,
"nothing fancy, reasonable price",
good fit,
fits great,
"perfect size, perfect thickness",
this will wear well and resist stains,
i wear these during winters and they are quite durable,
repeat buyer,
i like to feel of the garment comfortability,
nice quality shirt,
seems a little big for large,
but maybe i’m shrinking,
comfortable,
fits well,
shirt is a little thinner than expected,
fits just like it said,
"fit is very good, sleeves are not too long or baggy",
perfect work shirt,
nice shirt,
i will buy more,
xl is big,
we'll see if it shrinks after wash and dry,
really good quality products,
i bought six of these shirts for my husband to wear to work,
they look and fit great,
he wears them with jeans and he is very comfortable in them,
i have washed them several times now and there was no shrinkage and they have held their shape,
we are very happy with these shirts and will buy them again,
2xlt is just a bit small around the middle,
other than that it's a great shirt,
these shirts are nice because they have not shrunk or faded,
very good,
fits per size chart and comfortablely,
nice,
mjhmgh,
fitted just right,
very comfortable with heavy to medium material,
the large is like an x- large,
good quality,
thanks,
"good style, fits well",
good shirt,
"excellent quality, as my husband wanted",
excellent summer polo--cool and light,
its a good fit my brother love it,
if i could just make one suggestion if its possible to shorten the length of the shirt,
not wrinkle-free,
good value,
"my ""medium"" is at least a large, if not xl",
great shirt especially for the price,
good quality - fits great - looks good,
works for me,
bought these for uniforms to be worn at school,
we love the price and will probably be purchasing more if needed,
thank you,
great shirt at a great price,
just too thin to be a polo shirt,
even with undershirt didn't look right to me,
will be sending back,
"good shirt, comfortable, fits well",
its length was a bit too long for me,
good qaulity,
product is as described,
the fit is great,
like it,
very nice shirt,
fits well,
the sewing came undone where the sleeve attaches to the body of the shirt after the third washing,
not the best quality for the price,
price and quality,
perfect,
exactly what i wanted,
priced right,
i use it for golf,
working in dish room and this shirt is lightweight and just water resistant enough,
so far so good,
"nice feel to the fabric, looks great",
love it and fits great,
i get compliments all the time,
bought these for work,
great price,
its summer so i am not wearing them yet,
but hopefully they keep me warm,
it was a nice thick quality,
bought this for my husband as a work shirt,
"fits well and washed quite nicely, held it's shape",
i didnt dislike anything,
nice shirt,
"fits about right, certainly not too big",
good price,
should hold shape and size because it's 50/50,
"good price, decent quality",
fit fine,
looks fine,
shirt is cut for slimmer man,
a bit snug,
but usable,
comfortable and true to size,
"nice shirt, very comfortable",
great for a frail senior,
quality: medium,
thank you product was very nice and fit as expected,
the two polo shirts are fine and were very good for the fair price,
i use them mainly for golf,
my dad loved this shirt,
super comfortable,
jerzees 437 5,
6 oz,
50/50 jersey polo with spotshield-x-large-oxford,
i recommend this product for its quality and price,
nice t-shirt,
larger than i expected,
but good for the price,
can't beat this shirt for the price,
very comfortable,
quality,
don't like the banded arms and the material is a little flimsy,
great,
"color is not as in picture, a little dull",
fabric is inferior,
"arrived fast, great material, they run on the larger side",
stylish shirt and color wears good with jeans,
high quality material with a great fit,
thanks,
lighter knit than expected,
this is a nice shirt for everyday business dress,
"fits well, looks nice and is comfortable for work",
great buy,
cheaply made,
waste,
nice color and fit,
no complaints,
i got a set of these polos for my father as a gift,
he works a certain store where they are required to always wear a blue polo,
"he said they felt fine, they held up well, and he enjoyed the complements on the bright blue",
i love these jerzees polo shirts,
they fit very well and colors last quite a long time,
nice shirt,
didn't shrink at all,
ok,
i think it is going to be ok--tough order-one review said a little large and another said a little tight-,
one sleeve longer than the other will not buy this product again,
gave to brother for x-mas &amp,
he loved it,
good,
for student for school,
for student for school,
love the colour and soft texture,
"for the amount of money that they charge for this shirt, it is a steal",
great quality and fits perfectly,
i will buy a few more,
"it looks economical,",
but does the job for a growing teen,
fits perfect and feels great,
"i ordered 2xl and am 6' 2"" and 225 lbs",
nice shirt,
but the material is a lint magnet,
better by a lint roller with this shirt,
"for the price, this shirt works",
"nothing fancy, just a collared shirt",
using it for work in an office environment,
would buy more of these,
"little tight, should have bought xxl",
great weekend shirt for not much money,
good quality,
the fit is slim,
but not tight,
plenty long and the sleeves fit good,
isn’t like what i think,
good for the money,
the shirt was fine,
a little thinner material than expected,
"i wear it for work,and even  tho it is bigger than i want ,well now that winter coming i will wear turtle necks etc",
"nice shirt, arrived fast",
too tight,
thread too thin and pocket placed poorly,
overall poor quality construction,
i guess made in china,
perfect size and good material,
great for st patrick party,
sloppy looking,
i returned this shirt,
the material wasn’t as i expected it to be,
good fit and color,
prefer polo with pockets,
"it was a bit big,",
but seems nice and soft otherwise,
great product for the money,
was not small like some other things that i got,
fits well,
comfortable,
good length,
i plan to purchase more of this brand,
didn't like the material,
shirts were returned,
i dont like this polo,
"but i received what i paid, next time i will buy the expensive one",
the black one looks a bit better than white,
"item not as described they're not  tagless, they have a tag",
this will be great once we get cooler weather,
i bought it for my son's uniform he wears to school,
he walks there &amp,
back so i know it will keep his arms warm,
decent product for the purchase price,
"excellent quality, very pleased with the shirt",
very satisfied with these shirts,
"look nice, fit well, launder easily, good price",
"excellent for school, our kids only have 4 color choices for school",
these work perfectly especially for the price,
fit and look great price 1/5 the price of name brand would buy again,
i am pleased with the overall quality,
i was expecting it to be a bit softer since it is half polyester,
but it feels fine for the price,
i have other shirts that are blended polyester and cotton which are much softer,
i'll guess that they have a higher ratio of polyester,
the sizing is very accurate,
nice fit,
"cut much too small, i ordered up a size and will be line drying to avoid shrinkage",
fits perfectly,
work shirts so it fit as expected,
fits just fine,
shirt is fine,
but i think i could have gotten same product at same price anywhere,
casual wear,
great shirts at a very good price,
super happy,
"light weight, good for under fleece sweatshirts in the winter and fits the business casual attire required at work",
"they will shrink, hang to dry for longer life",
nice shirt,
feels well made and is comfortable,
good,
very nice polo,
"actually ordered it for my daughter, as she prefers the looser fit",
this shirt fits good  no complaints,
would recommend to family and friends,
this was a gift and the person it was purchased for seemed to like it,
nice fit,
very pleased,
liked that it breathes,
but little tight in arms,
nice,
great for a cheap polo,
"the material isn't as nice as most polos though, it's closer to the material of a course tshirt than to a polo",
bought this for my dad who lives in arizona,
"it was his ""winter"" sweater",
lol,
he absolutely loved it,
"fit perfectly, good quality",
would buy from this company again,
it's a nice polo for the price,
"fabric is ok, doesn't look chip and i think is worth the buy",
i will probably order in a different color,
they fit perfect,
"suprised by the quality, great value",
exactly as described and very comfortable,
no,
good shirt for golf and wearing layers,
short and wide,
"just a bad fit altogether, cheap thin material",
perfect fit,
christmas gift to my husband,
"nice shirt, fits good, great value",
"looks good in the picture,",
but it's a bit blah when you get it,
"the color was a little lighter than i expected, and the quality was lower than i expected",
"however, for the price",
whatever lol,
great shirt,
needed a great fitting black polo for work,
very comfortable,
good,
justice,
"nice weight polo, well constructed and color as shown in picture",
ordering more for employees,
shirt tail a little long,
i bought these as work uniform shirts for my job and they fit me just right and i love the quality of the fabric as well,
its been a,
while since i have been wearing these polo shirts and they are still very comfortable,
"basic polo, fits as expected",
would purchase again,
this was a perfect buy for my son who needed a green shirt for a concert,
"it fits well, is made well and had a great price",
quality was bad,
"returned , now what i expected",
was just a little smaller than expected,
being normally a large i would order an extra large,
great product fit was awesome,
love the color,
run very small,
for kids,
"good shirt,not to thick and not to thin",
"i like those shirts, comfortable good size, all the info correct so recommend for any body , i going o buy some more",
it’s a little big,
but it’s is for guys otherwise it’s good,
i use as my uniform as a cashier,
great value,
very durable,
my son luvs it,
"fit was excellent, would purchase again",
shrinks after washing despite what they might say,
perfect fit,
perfect for cooler weather,
poor quality of material,
disappointed,
nice shirt just don't dryer it,
shrinks something awful,
other then that fit like it was suppose to and good size,
after decades of dealing with rl shirts that don't last and cost 10x more,
not an exaggeration,
", i find these to be a better fit and value",
i started buying these in long sleeve and got one in short sleeve by accident when i changed to sandstone and the picture showed long sleeve white,
"being a prime order, i figured if it wasn't right when it arrived, i would ship it back",
"well, color was nice,",
but it came as short sleeve,
a happy accident because i would never have started ordering these if i hadn't discovered how much better these were than my polos,
i order mediums,
"the order choices show s,m,l, and on and on",
"then, they say adult s, adult m, adult l, etc",
"since they don't say child s,m",
i took a chance on the lower prices that came with the exclusion of the word adult,
i'll have to assume adult label must be a euphemism for b&amp,
t or something else associated with extra roomy because i'm not child size,
i'm currently a 44-36,
the waste is loose enough to hide less than flat abs,
the shoulders fit without hanging over and don't look sloppy yet still have a lot of room in the chest and body,
"length was great for low cut jeans,",
but too much if not tucked in,
much more suited to being tucked in to deal with below waste jeans issues,
i actually found myself returning for a small which is really strange sizing,
i gave very little thought to the claim of spot protection until i watched salsa disappear with just a wet sponge,
so far they are holding up through washes,
but i caution anyone who does not thoroghly understand how laundry machines work,
you cannot use high heat and the toughest cycle for every type of garment,
"unless you are wearing these on a construction job and letting it sit for a week before washing, you should use gentle wash cycles and low heat drying with finish guard sensor dryers",
"if you don't have access to proper dryers or time to watch over timed laundromat machines, remove",
while slightly damp and use hangers for final drying,
"everything will last longer with more care, regardless",
my customer was very pleased with her shirts,
they arrived quickly and are a very good quality shirt,
"great shirt, great price",
all good,
i purchased this shirt for my son,
it fits perfectly,
it has not shrunk in the wash,
it's true to size,
the color has not faded,
ok,
good quality,
very nice,
quality shirt,
"fits right, good quality,fast shipping",
"the shirt fits perfectly and it was a great price, especially since it is part of my work uniform",
"great price, and the fit was perfect for my body frame",
colors mixed great with pants/shorts,
i'll be buying more,
i love them they fit great,
fits well,
like the bright color,
this is a step above a t,
shirt,
its poor quality chinese junk,
perfect,
as described,
great quality,
even better than i expected,
i got one about a year ago and it still looks great and still white,
nice comfortable jersey,
looked great on my husband,
fits well,
nice shirt for the cost,
it's ok,
"fit great, came quickly, wish the fabric was a bit softer",
it's a nice comfortable shirt,
i use it for work where we have to wear green,
will buy more here in the future,
son loves it,
i think he says it feels really good next to his skin,
i like the slightly longer short sleeves,
nice shirt,
fits good,
happy with my purchase,
gift for step son,
fits him as expected,
he's happy with this shirt,
nice collar rich color,
exactly what i expected,
comfortable,
well built shirt,
but tail is way too long,
good product,
but the fit was too small,
runs small,
"fits great, feels good",
"i bought this shirt as something to wear to work, my wife likes the way i look in it so i'm nervous to wear it and end up ruining it",
"very comfortable, though and i will likely be getting more like it",
fit good and comfortable,
better value than i anticipated for the price thank you for a good deal will by again better than walmart brands,
fits well,
looks beautiful,
but you get what you pay for it's a low-quality shirt i don't expect it to last for a long time,
"we bought a bunch for work, they wash easy and are nice to wear will get some more",
since the price is great,
shirt was a little tite for an xl,
perfect fit,
bought for my husband who likes a long sleeve shirt,
bought one to try for quality and fit,
he loves them will be ordering additional for his use,
perfect fit,
good product,
"fits great, color is great",
use for work,
awesome shirt great fit,
beautiful shirt,
"looks good and feels good,",
but sweaty in this hot south texas weather is no good,
the size was just as expected,
the only flaw is that you can definitely tell that it isn't all cotton,
there is a slight sheen to it,
"still, i will be getting a couple more",
"i really like the fit of my shirts, no dislikes",
white fabric is very see-through,
one star,
i have a red one that i like quite a bit,
4 stars,
very good quality,
did not shrink in the wash,
comfortable and fits nicely,
wash and wear friendly,
great shirt the only thing that would make it better would be a pocket,
shirt fit great,
fabric is kind of thin,
but comfortable and wears well,
was what i expected,
i love this shirt on first wearing,
perfect fit and feel,
"great shirt, especially for the price",
i will update the review if there's anything to note after washing and wearing more,
i picked up a few of these,
they are comfortable and hold up well,
perfect polo for work,
thank you,
nice shirt,
for $7,
20 you get what you pay for,
"this did not fit well, very large arms and quite long",
down to elbow,
baggy and the material felt cheap,
i returned it,
"nice shirt,even looks after a wash",
great work shirt for hubby,
held up to multiple washings,
it hasn't faded or stretched,
would buy again,
"good quality at reasonably priced, fitting is as described",
overall good value for money,
"quick delivery, great product",
the shirts were too large for my son,
but that was my fault i should have ordered a smaller size,
love it,
correct sizing,
nice shirt,
very good quality for the price,
fit as expected,
the polo looks great,
hopefully or son will love it too,
this is a great shirt for a great price,
i wear these for work and it's nice to know i can get them so easily,
was a gift,
boyfriend works in a kitchen and loves the lighter fabric,
the stain resistant factor is a plus because it's much easier to maintain,
i haven't washed it yet,
i tried it on and it fits fine,
good fit,
but sleeves were long,
not suitable for tropical climates at it get too hot,
nice,
this fits so well and it is comfortable,
i imagine it will last a few years with my daily use for work,
i have to wear black polo shirts at work,
i believe i should of gotten a smaller size,
"other than that, love the light weight feeling",
fit very well and it is very comfortable,
material was not the quality that i was looking for,
perfect fit with regglan sleeves and a long waist,
"nice shirt, good fit, and good price",
good price and looks good on my husband,
"the length was perfect and he is 6'3""",
he said the fabric felt good,
a little small,
but maintain color pretty well &amp,
fabric is good quality,
nice shirts,
fits great and looks good too,
nice to do business with,
"ok,",
but not quite the quality as the haggars i got at similar price,
que me queda bien,
perfect quality perfect fit,
i am always skeptical about buying clothes online,
but this company is amazing,
perfect,
i use it for work and its super confortable,
i have to wear this kind of shirt to work,
i ordered five brands of shirts just to see which one was the most durable,
"this shirt, although it is not the most expensive one, is the most durable",
i paid way more for shirts that now have holes in them,
for that reason i ordered more and will be sticking with this one in the future,
"if you need a shirt that doesn't fall apart for a great price, i highly recommend this",
very nice,
ok,
loved it,
"good fit, nice buy",
great customer service,
this is a great shirt,
my husband has a very long back and this shirt was long enough even for him,
fits very well and fabric is nice too,
i am happy with this shirt,
the size is true,
"the shirt is lightweight, as i expected",
my husband just love the shirt,
bought for my son,
great quality-fabulous deal,
"buena calidad hay que pedir una talla menos de la que se usa, corre un poco grande",
convenient delivery and the shirt quality is good,
kinda big,
purchased several of these,
"good quality,  good price, fit very well on my big guys",
the fit is perfect,
feels like a t-shirt with a collar,
love them,
good product for the price,
would buy another one just in a different color,
"these are a little thinner than i expected,",
but for the price i can’t complain,
a good serviceable shirt,
i’ll probably get more for worhshop wear,
shirt fell apart after 2 washes,
loved product and material,
use for son's school uniform,
larger than what the size suggest,
don't waste your money unless this is for a one time event and you just need something cheap,
"they are not the best quality,",
but that makes sense given the price,
about the same quality as a t-shirt,
looks very good,
material is good quality,
ok,
it's a comfortable tshirt with a collar,
literally t shirt material with a collar sewed on,
ok,
the fit was great and very comfy,
great color and keeping it's shape after a couple washes,
nice shirt,
thank you,
"i was concerned how this polo would hold up after washing,",
but did great,
no shrinkage at all,
light weight and soft,
great shirts,
i use these for the uniforms for my business,
i won't use any other shirts,
i own a restaurant and it gets extremely hot in the kitchen,
"but these are light and they fit really well, especially around the arms",
great material,
fits as expected,
it was worth the price,
plus it's a great fit,
the quality isn't great,
you might get mistaken for a worker at k-mart or big 5 if you wear these,
happy with my purchase,
great shirt,
liked it,
"great fit, nice deep color, dries beautifully",
"nice shirt- looks good, fits good, feels good",
material is very cheap quality,
great jersey for winter mountain biking,
runs about 1/2 size small,
and a great buy,
"good buy, did not shrink after washing",
my favorite work shirt,
"nice feel,not to tight or loose",
perfect fit,
i'm  a big upper body guy for a large size long sleave to fit just right,
keeps the sun off just fine,
tapers at waist,
would not recommend again,
its decent for the price,
great value for the money,
bien,
pros: doesn't lose shape or shorten in the dryer,
the collar retains shape,
i normally wear large,
"5""10', 210 pounds",
and it fits me well without being tight,
long enough to stay tucked in,
cons: the fabric feels like a t-shirt and not the soft kind,
it's not uncomfortable,
but a little scratchy,
conclusion: it's good for the price,
i just wish it was softer,
nice and light,
good quality,
great shirt,
great product for the price,
nice shirt,
good fit as stated,
i bought one for a work shirt and its very comfy,
even after a wash it didnt fade and stayed soft n kept its shape,
i will most definitely buying another,
good value,
washes well so far,
"the size is accurate, the fit is just right, and the spot shield is an added plus",
"overall, very happy with the purchase",
satisfied,
it's a redskins color,
",httr",

the perfect addition to school uniforms,

it fits him perfectly,
great price too,
good quality uniform shirt,
comfortable and light,
very comfortable shirt,
"fit very well, bright colors feels great",
this is a nice shirt overall,
but it is made a bit large,
"nice material, looks and fits great",
arrived right on time,
excellent,
just as described &amp,
quick delivery,
exactly right,
would like it better if it had a pocket,
ok,
me gusto el producto,
"great shirt, great fit, great price",
the shirt is in good condition,
i like the color and the quality,
this is an interesting work shirt,
"it wicks water away really well,",
"but it also makes me sweat like crazy and then it doesn't absorb much, so i feel drenched",
"aside from that, the shirt is a really comfortable fabric, so it may be better in the colder months",
would not buy again,
the material is cool and is helpful if you sweat a lot,
comfortable and washes well,
buy the next size up for an after washing better fit,
good product for the price use it for work,
got this shirt for my husband,
fit perfect,
at first i ordered 2 shirts,
after wearing them i ordered two more,
"the size, fabric and colors were perfect",
the price was outstanding,
just what i needed for work,
now i can wear it for red fridays,
i was exactly what i expected,
fits good nice looking,
love it,
nice light bodied material,
color is vibrant,
well made shirt,
the size fits larger than others,
fits well and looks great,
great buy,
for the price these shirts are worth every penny,
fits as expected,
no shrinkage or discolorations,
nice heavy material,
these shirts are lite material and feel great,
"i'm not sure about durability so i will update my review,",
but for the price i couldn't beat them,
i did not dislike the shirt i just got the wrong size it was bigger than expected,
very comfortable,
not satisfied,
like,
needed a shirt to look like skipper from gilligan's island - great look,
"quick shipping, good experience",
like it very much,
"pretty comfortable clothing, just a bit bigger than what i expected",
love the way it fits,
and didnt shrink when i washed it,
great product would buy again,
"it wasn't used much yet,",
but very good so far,
good value,
fits well,
great under a sweater,
"product is as described, fit as expected",
thank you,
it was a gift for my husband and it fit perfectly,

"not a thick shirt at all, just light and comfy",
would recommend,
nice shirt - nice fit,

after six washes they are still holding their color and very comfortable to wear,
shirts were great,
it came on time and item fit well,
looks great,
"what did i expect,",
but size is large,
great quality and fit,
the fit and look,
perfect fit,
size was right on the money,
not bad,
it was big because i erroneously orders an xl instead of a l,
nice top,
great,
"yes, you can feel that it's not 100% cotton,",
but they fit,
the problem with most store shirts these days is that the sleeves are always too short,
great fit,
my husband loved it for work,
looks huge when you receive it,
but its true to size,
holds color well,
love the shirt,
very comfortable,
fits well,
really resists stains,
perfect shirt right size,
can't wait to order more,
great item  just too long for my husband,
you get what you pay for,
good to use at home,
just as described,
works perfectly for my work uniform,
better than advertised i recommend,
"the fit, quality, and price are great",
"really good quality long sleeve polo i wear it to work alot, everytime i wash it it looks brain new",
perfecta,
great fit,
ok,
fit prefect,
keeps it color and shape after many washes,
still wearing it often,
"these shirts look nice,",
but made very cheap,
holes after wearing it once,
i like the way it fits,
"good product,  great price",
comfortable and stylish,
the shirt fit well,
fyi,
it is made of very thin material,
nice shirt at reasonable price 👍🏾👍🏾,
"this is lightweight, easy care, no logos on the front",
good,
"a nice casual shirt, or under sweaters",
washes and dries quickly,
"the fit is great, not to big nor to small, true to size",

i am pleased with these polos,
husband needed one white and one black one for work,
these are very affordable and well worth the buy,
great quality,
"good fit, good color, material a little thin",
but i guess fitting with price,
material seems thin and does fit slightly small,
great fit,
able to wear with slacks and jeans,

it is actually short sleeved,
poor material &amp,
craftsmanship,

"everything is great, except the sleeves are very long",
"like, down to your elbow",
perfect fit,
great shirt,
it worked great for what i needed it for it is a bit cheap so far as the fabric quality is concerned,
however for the price it is better then i expected overall a great product,
this t-shirt is too small,
i've work a men's size large for years,
this shirt is more of a small-medium,
"nice shirt fits well, good fabric, washed well, didn't fade,",
have only worn once,
but really like the way it feels,
nice,
perfect fit,
"nice, lightweight, comfortable to play golf in",
"if you're looking for a great buy, this is it",
looks and feels great,
my son just loves these shirts,
i ordered a 5x,
it fits,
but snug,
very much like t shirt with a collar,
thinner material,
i got this for my son to wear to work,
"says it fits fine, just right for the job",
"they're good shirts for the money,",
but they run large,
nice shirt for practice,
lightweight and flexible during play,
dries quickly if wet,
like the shirts very much,
"smooth transaction, shirt was a little big on me,",
but will be ok,
i'll probably buy some more,
you wanna feel like ron swanson? get this,
quality is as expected,
very nice,
material is durable and great for summer,
fits well,
it was for my grandson,
nice shirt,
material is not as smooth as i would like,
"also, it picks up lint easy",
its a little large,
"but, its cool",
great shirt for the money,
not much cotton,
ok,
for what you are paying you are getting your moneys worth,
the best price and great quality,
excellent,
i liked how long it is,
but it fits small to be a large shirt,
fit perfectly,
nice school uniform shirts,
"the fit was right, and the material was not too thin",
"the purple color looks nice, too",
nothing more to say 0 i luv it,
a little thinner than i expected,

i order small size,
but this one is too small for me,
i  like  the  product,
used  for  sport,
shirts that arrived were navy and long sleeved when what i ordered was royal blue and short sleeve,
wrong color,
i washed it and wore it once and the seams are coming apart,
fits great,
perfect for everyday use,
fabric is a little thin,
but ok for the money,
good shirt,
good to go,
great shirts,
these are replacements for worn out shirts,
good light summer shirt,
"he color is right, it's hard to mess up i need a break summer  sun",
i like the pool over style,
great fit and color i havent washed or printed on yet,
but i will soon find out and i will note that later,
poor quality,
the shirt does not wrinkle easily,
keeps shape after washing,
size meets my expectations somewhat,
the fabric used is very thin,
acceptable up there,
"love em, have &amp",
will buy more,
ok shirt just to big for me,

i love these shirts,

he normally wears a size large,
but this shirt was a little snug,
"it was a good price, so i can't complain too much",
"since it was such a good price, i went ahead and bought it in an extra-large for him",
the extra-large fit a lot better,
it seemed to fit him like most mens size large normally fit,
"it's a decent quality shirt for the price, i would just suggest order the next size up, unless you like the shirt to fit a little more ""fitted""",
i was only able to wear it one time,
for the money can't be beat,
ok product,
quality 2q,
perfect size,
nice looking,
well made,
runs small,
i took the navy color in this and size medium it is perfect and reasonable price,
"the picture of the shirt here looks so nice,",
"but when i actually held it in my hand, the fabric is thin and too plain",
"with the price, i can find and buy a similar shirt at the same price or a little more with some style at local stores",
nice fit,

the fit size is amazing perfect,

"this shirt is a rather nice shirt, fits well and the spotshield does what it says it does",
but maybe its a little too good,
it is so good it'll repeal your own sweat and by that i mean the shirt doesn't wick away moisture as one would hope it would,
my recommendations are not to wear it in the summer and not to wear it,
while doing strenuous physical activities,

the collar pilled a little after the first washing and it holds a lot of static electricity,
even if you are using bounce dryer sheets,
for eork it is eay to big and the material makes me itch,
niceeeeee,
"good product, good price",
but it took more than a week from nj to fl,
thin,
but fits well,
happpy,
the price was great for team shirts,
it's just a shirt,
no more no less,
i read reviews before making the purchase very good fit for my long-armed guy,
ok shirt for the price,

product ok,
the collar is lopsided,
perfect work shirt,
my husband doesn't like it,

this shirt is for school use,
it washes and dries good,
polo shirt,
it fits nicely,
have had it for 2 days only,
comfortable,
"i ordered a small, it is way ok big &amp",
the color is not near what the picture shows,
it is almost white,
order ash grey,
i used it for work,
only bad thing is that when you wash it the shirts the get small,
i am a large,
but this fits more like an xl,
nice,
nice shirt,
gave as a gift,

happy customer here,
great shirt was exactly what i expected,
good,
great fit,
got this one for when it starts getting a little cooler during the second half of the volleyball season,
works great as a volleyball referee shirt,
be aware that it runs a bit large,
"i typically wear an xl shirt,",
but ordered a large,
based on some other reviews,
the large fits perfectly,
got two of them,
very happy with this shirt,
nice feel,
fits well and looks good,
sweat proof,
bought for my husband to wear to work,
"comfortable, durable, and fit well",
shipping and cost were great,
the color is much different in person than in picture,
i would recommend taking a closer look at the color before buying and take note that the color is a shade or two lighter,
i love these polo shirts,
i bought all the colors,
"if there were more colors, i would buy them instantly",
"nice polo, fits as expected",
good shirt,
"nice shirt,wash up nice",
very good,
the shirt fit as described,
great price,
i wear these as a work uniform,
will order 3 more,
good shirts,
bad material,
very synthetic,
i feel very sweaty when wear this,
great quality for the price,
they fulfill a need that is professional looking without breaking the bank,
i will order more,
inexpensive,
just what i was looking for,
loved it,
sleeves are gigantic,
pretty good,
but i like it shorter,
very bad material,
it's what i expected for a cheap shirt,
"fits nicely,",
attracts a lot of hair in the dryer,
perfect,
well-made,
durable,
slimming style,
i liked it,
this ok,
okay product,
nice looking shirt,
nice,
perfect,
perfecto,
great,
very happy,
"fit well, color was as depicted",
bought them for work shirts,
"great quality, fast delivery and great price",
ok fit,
not fab,
color,
5 star,
price was good,
i’m not a fan of the elastic in the sleeves,
fit as expected,
ordered this instead of spending three times as much for my son's school uniform,
"true to description, fits great, color lasts through many washes, and it was a great price",
i will be buying more in the near future,
i love it,
"bought these for the kids school uniforms, so far so good for the price",
very happy with them,
great polo and fast delivery,
"it fits as expected, good material",
delivery took a bit longer though,
good fit and looks good,
the shirts are great,
"soft and comfy, and they fit as expected",
the threading on the hem tore on the first wash,
wouldn't buy again,
perfect,
"had to get these for work, fit great fast shipping and they don't shrink down to nothing like some brands do",
would definately recommend if you're looking for plain colored polos,
nice and comfortable,
the price is great,
but the size is just a bit small compared to my other xls,
if you need a regular fit as compared to a trim or slim fit this shirt might right a bit snug,
just what i was looking for at a great price,
great shirt,
"tough, affordable and good fit",
na,
excellent,
i got more than expected from this brand and am very satisfied,
fine,
loved this shirt,
works great for my husband’s work shirt,
fits good and seems to last,
nice,
love these shirts,
great value looks good,
"fits excellent, fast delivery",
well made and very comfortable,
perfect for summer time weather,
my son will like these for work,
great,
good quality and washes well maintains color and shape,
great price,
love the color,
excellent shirt for the price,
nice and breezy,
fits great,
comfortable,
great for the price,
thanks,
you get what you pay for,
this shirt is very poor quality,
i'm very disappointed,
this shirt is comfortable and still professional,
just ok,
great fit,
just what you expect,
"no obvious branding, very plain, it makes a good work shirt",
"good cheap polo shirts, fits good",
good shirt,
exactly what i thought i was ordering,
like the color,
buy a size smaller than you need,
feels very comfortable,
i likes it,
they fit perfect,
good price for simple easy to wear,
great shirt,
1/2 size small prior to wash,
rips way too easily from the slightest pull,
"there are 3 reasons i buy a shirt, style, fit and color",
"this polo shirt meet all my expectation of style, fit and color",
i was very satisfied with it and i like for the color and fit,
i would recommend this polo shirt to family and friends,
i like the delivery time and the colors,
but the fabric was not to my liking,
nice and comfortable,
"everything was as described, good quality, sizing was accurate, well packed and shipped and i highly recommend this product",
click thumbs up if you found my review helpful,
thanks,
very happy with the quality and fit of my shirt,
good deal at a good price,
perfect,
mala calidad,
cheap quality,
right on the money 👍,
fit perfect,
love it,
bad quality,
will not buy again,
great,
one of the polos have a stain on the collar,
perfect,
these long sleeves shirts are great,
"it's light weight, great quality and perfect to wear under your clothes",
love these shirts,
quality material,
2 loved ones are going to love them too,
thank you so much,
it feels nice and good price,
love it,
school uniform,
shirt fit fine,
"a tad too big,",
but that's my fault,
i wanted them roomy to wear to work,
"overall, a great, lightweight shirt to work in at a very reasonable price",
i like that,
great buy,
love it,
"sent wrong shirt, cheaply made, would never wear it",
would never return to this site,
"pretty color, good fit",
great shirts,
"nice fit , nice look",
well worth the price,
nice shirt,
good price,
very rugged shirt,
love the shirt,
terrible fit,
poor quality and cheap materials,
not to mention the packaging was horrible,
it came pretty much stuffed into an envelop all wrinkled and looked worn,
very disappointed,
"oh, and i have to pay for shipping to return it",
good,
good fit,
perfect as my sons work shirt,
love it,
great shirt,
simple and comfortable,
i will buy more colors,
great buy,
"nice polos, thin",
"but not to thin, i'd say this is more for someone who wants something breathable, maybe for something active, i didn't know the difference between pique and jersey",
"but now that i know i'd prefer pique over this, this feels like it won't last, don't get white because it's see through, and this isn't 100% cotton so be aware that's why it might feel lighter and thinner",
fit great,
nice shirts i needed them for my work,
arrived in a timely manner,
i will be ordering them again in the future,
well fitting shirt,
i use this product as a work uniform,
outstanding,
"the shirts fit great wash and dry without shrink or losing shape, if son would stop growing, should last entire school year",
"nice fit, very breathable",
"nice material, good stitching, fits well",
i like the shirt a lot,
but have to get a smaller size next time,
they have a little bit bigger size,
i ordered a medium shirt for my  kid and its a little bit big,
i  haven't wash it yet if this shrinks it will be perfect for him,
excelente,
fits goods,
made well,
not as breathable as i would like,
great value and fit,
"it says it is spot shield, not quite",
"otherwise, it fits just fine",
great fit and cloth,
nice colors,
will buy again,
"good shirt for the price, wears good, makes a good golf shirt",
shirt fits good and has a long tail that will stay in your pants or shorts,
great for my use to have a work shirt,
quality is ok for the price,
i ordered 2 shirts rec'd one - medium,
missing shirt - extra large,
"cheap,",
"but low quality,  guess i shouldn't be surprised at that combo",
just what i expected 👍,
the price,
nice shirt for the price,
everything,
dress policy at worked changed and required that we wear collared shirts now,
i used to be able to wear long sleeve tee's in winter time,
these shirts are basically long sleeve t-shirts with a collar and i love it,
great shirt for the price,
i have bought 3 more since,
it fits me perfectly,
good comfortable shirt,
cotton 60/40 might be better,
the shirt is very thin,
very nice shirt,
loved them the quality was great,
well made,
thank you,
i would by them again in a heartbeat,
could not find anyone in the stores,
i like it just  a little too tight,
good shirt for the money,
i thought for sure i ordered a large,
"but, i got a small",
it didn't discover that until after i washed it,
all good,
men's large should be women's large,
fair,
didn't use them too big and smelled bad,
"love shirt goes perfect with tennis shoes the fit is comfortable ,material is soft great price would definely recommend product",
i liked the color,
nice color selection,
soft material,
fits well,
perfected,
great product,
"perfect,just ordered 2 more for my son",
thanks,
great fit on my son,
dc,
great long sleeve shirt for the office,
"perfect for true to size, hasn't faded or shrunk",
i'll be buying more for work,
comfortable,
nice shirt for the value,
i liked it,
looks good,
perfect,
i ordered a xxxl shirt which is normally very loose on me,
the shirt i got i could not even put over my head and pull it down,
"when i got this shirt and took it out of the package, i was pleasantly surprized",
then i put it on to find it was a kids shirt in size,
"luckily, i have a 12 year old grandson",
tat it did fit,
"i'm not sure about there other shirts,",
"but this one should rate ""do not buy""",
"thought it would be more ""dry-fitty-like,"" so, ok",
definitely not bad for price,
not bad at all,
"so, as expected and such",
comfortable,
my grandson loved them,
"pros: fits well, comfortable",
cons: attracts every piece of lint in a five mile radius,
price for quality,
a bit large good quality though,
"my husband loves them, wants more of them for golf",
i liked how the material felt and the way it fit,
but good overall,
love the dhio,
like the shirt,
good,
ok,
love it,
totally satisfied,
as advertised,
adequate,
considering the very reasonable price it is not bad except it is one size too big,
bought for my son,
he wears a medium,
but this was way too small,
great polo shirts fits great,
thin material fits poorly,
what charged to ship back,
this is a wide extra large,
very good product doesn't feel cheap &amp,
very comfortable,
"good stuff, really soft, fine color, good transportation",
came as promised,
"love this shirt, i am wearing it now and it feels great",
"very comfy, great value for the price",
highly recommended,
it was shipped fast,
but fits just a little big,
happy,
the quality is poor,
"but since return is not free, decides to keep it then",
shirt is of ok quality,
but its over sized,
good shirt for big guys,
polo shirts were of good quality and fit well,
it came in a bag and was great,
ok,
👌🏼,
much as i expected,
no complaints nice quality,
i expected the t shirt to have a polo sign on the front,
as it is resembles a poor quality,
very good shirt,
fit ad i expected and good quality,
recomendado 100%,
great product,
will order more,
the fabric is soft and the shirt fits great,
great product,
great price,
comfortable and doesn’t fade,
excellent,
any &amp,
all,
they were just want we needed,
they fit as expected and wash up nicely,
great fit and very fast delivery,
gift,
comfortable,
great for workwear,
these are  great for work,
no moon here lol  i'm very happy with these shirts stain proof wal mart  smile,
a solid polo for the money,
very good fits well,
material is pretty thin,
they fit,
the fit is horrible ordered one size med did not fit right sent back shipping expensive to send back ordered small and doesn't fit well,
nice clean black polo shirt,
"fit as expected,did not shrink",
great fit very comfortable,
no good,
great shirts,
my husband loves these shirts,
all four i bought fit like every other medium shirt he owns,
great casual shirt to wear out &amp,
about,
good value,
i like it,
"nice shirt, good quality",
the sleeves are a bit long,
the material doesn't breathe very well so you tend to get very hot,
i work in the service industry,
"little tight, particularly in sleeves",
perfect,
this shirts where for my dad for his birthday present and he likes them very much,
great color  for men,
fits well,
but is not super comfortable,
i guess the 50% polyester is why,
it is a tough shirt though,
"good quality, color as expected",
thin material,
but perfect normal fit,
this is an excellent shirt at a great price,
i have worn the short sleeve version of this shirt for years and love the fit,
"this shirt fits perfectly and unlike many similar,",
but more expensive brands the sleeves are long enough that they don't move when you lift your arms up,
the cuffs hug your wrists and stay put,
i have more of these on order,
"all i can say fast shipment, and exactly what i was looking for",
thank you so much and looking to buy some more,
the fit has to be a little more loose around the torso,
great,
great,
fit ok a little big,
but comfortable,
awesome quality shirt,
horrible o estrellas,
i got this shirt for my sister,
she has to wear a green shirt at work and she loved it,
thank you,
good for the price,
all good,
item as described,
fast shipping,
perfect,
thin fabric and flimsy collar,
"material is very thin, it tends to get worn down very quickly",
"fitting good , length little high so need to in the shirt in jeans",
cloth quality is not much good,
excellent shirt,
excellent,
not to heavy not to thin,
a+++,
little girls short sleeve,
wrong product,
"used it as a bathroom floor rag, not worth my time and effort to return it",
"great, comfortable shirt that seems to be very well made",
just right,
it fits as the size chart,
many compliments,
i like to cook,
"i should wear an apron,",
but i usually don't,
hours after i put on one of these shirts bacon grease got me right in the belly,
"put it in the wash, and it's gone",
great,
excellent,
it is a simple thing,
i don't like,
it held the sweat in did not breath,
"great fit, great color",
love the material,
"a little thinner material than most,",
but is almost a linen feel to it rather than a standard cotton polo,
great shirt,
like,
"size is large, and quality is not really good",
"fast shipping, great price",
we be ordering more soon,
fit as expected and arrived when promised,
i loved it,
wrinkles wrinkles,
"it's fine, nothing special",
material is not great,
rough,
would not purchase again,
great shirt for the price,
"prepare to have your nipples displayed to the world, and if you're wearing a wifebeater prepare to look like you're wearing a bra",
it's pretty comfy though,
nothing special here can find better shirts at closeout stores,
very cheap-flimsy material-was not expensive so i should have guessed,
would not purchase again,
the fit is right,
it came on time and in good shape and the color is vibrant,
i will be buying more of these,
it's a red shirt just as advertised,
it fits well,
"but even for me, it's still a little to long on the sleeves and fits more like a unisex shirt than a males long sleeve shirt",
great color and fits perfect,
great for a work shirt,
didn't shrink in the wash and i have ordered several more,
would buy again,
"i knew it was made by jerzees,",
"but i thought it would be at least opaque, not see through",
it’s okay other than looking a little baggy,
maybe shrinking with a wash will help it,
i ordered a l,
very comfortable,
excellent fit,
very comfortable,
yes comfortable and inexpensive,
this was a gift for my dad,
worked fine,
"nice, quality made",
no pocket,
size a little off,
excellent,
good product good price,
its a little tight on me,
"i use medium,",
but this shirt is too small for me,
wish i could return it,
these polos are the best fitting polos i've ever had and they're dirt cheap,
it was a little snug,
but i can deal with it,
other than that it was great,
it's part of my halloween costume,
material is thinner than excepted,
great product,
recommend,
thanks,
"it fit perfectly, and i loved the color",
great product as expected,
awesome,
great product,
fits well and is comfortable,
fits great,
a++,
nicer quality than i thought it was going to be cheap material,
the size isn’t true,
fits perfect,
great fit,
i like the sleeve lengths,
most sleeves i find a little short,
"this seems to fit well at sleeve, and collar",
love the t shirt,
fast shipping and great product,
bigger than expected,
too large,
shirt is looking good,
it runs a size to big,
lightweight comfortable shirt,
like,
"the material so bad ,i never buy from this brand",
everything was perfect,
i love em,
fits great,
"excellent fit,  so cool",
great shirts,
at an excellent price,
"good shirt, i will be ordering another",
trabajo,
nice fit and material,
i had to order a smaller size,
but great for work,
the polo does not shrink at all so good buy,
nice shirt for the price,
i bought it to wear to work,
"great shirt, great fit@",
really like it,
a lot thinner than expected,
but it got the job done,
my husband likes the shirt and it washes nicely,
"great price, exact color and fast shipping",
came with a hole in it,
school uniform,
paper thin quality,
can see undershirt through it,
quality was just not what i expected at all,
i got the white one so maybe the colored ones would be better,
"i was skeptical because of the price,",
but am very happy with my purchase,
fits well and is holding up better than shirts i paid 4x as much for,
all is ok,
thank you for a good product and great service at a great price,
i needed white polo for work,
you beat the hell out of what i got at banana republic,
my expectations were surpassed based on the quality and fit,
i ordered more because i was very happy with the product,
not a quality polo,
it good,
it really good,
medium size is small compared to other brands and fabric is too thin,
arms tight,
"use these shirts for work, everyone is asking where i purchased them so they can get some too",
great  product,
what can i say other than it was exactly what i expected and fit well,
"i like the idea of ""spotshield"" since i apparently get stuff on my front quite often",
fit as expected,
"shirt was entirely too big,",
but perfectly fine otherwise,
"the shirt fits perfectly, only problem was i ordered a white shirt and received a black shirt",
he is enjoying his new shirt anyway😀,
"ok,",
but i wish it had more cotton,
my fault,
i don't even check such things,
lovely bright blue color and nice light material,
"perfect, just what i wanted",
these are nice for the price,
but they run small,
will buy again and highly recommend,
poor quality,
shirts were exactly what i needed and arrived in a timely manner,
after 5 months these shirts have faded to a dusty dark red,
color,
i love it will be ordering more exceeded my expectations,
i like the color and fit me perfect,
too small,
trim fit,
i like it,
fits good,
thank you :-,
i found the shirt to be made of a very light cotton mix and it fits smaller than many of my other xxl shirts,
i forgot to send it back,
the length of the sleeves is disportionately  large,
fits good,
'm looks good,
i love the way thr shirt fits,
"i buy them slightly larger because i enjoy a loose, comfortable fit",
"i also like that sweat don't appear, especially underarm",
nice set of shirts purchased to ward off the chill working in retail coolers as a layered apporach,
launders great and hold form,
no need to iron,
do ppl that anymore?,
just pull from dryer and lay flat till cool,
done,
would trust to purchase again,
was supposed to get a long sleeved polo,
received a short sleeved shirt in the wrong size,
nice long sleeved collared shirt for a wry reasonable price,
nice,
very good quality of the fabric,
fit nice,
a good quality&amp,
true to size as ordered,
my grandson is tall and slim so the shirts were too wide for him and he didn't like the texture,
"this shirt is blue, oh so blue",
"if you like the sky and and fresh air then this is the the shirt for you, if not then go to the under too",
it doesn't get more blue than this,
great shirt and great fit and it's blue too,
fast delivery,
will order again in future,
thanks,
came as expected,
did not shrink when washed,
just great for my son,
i would purchase again,
high-quality shirt,
the colour is just like the picture,
very poor material,
too way too large,
very disapointed,
do not recommend to anyone,
smaller than expected and fabric was not what i expected,
but it it's a nice shirt,
ordered a medium size polo,
but was too large so i had to return,
good shirt,
wearable,
fit as expected,
very nice long-sleeved polo shirt,
i may order additional colors also,
"very comfortable, yet dressy looking for all occasions",
just what i expected,
"nice for the price, just runs a little big",
it does shrink a little though,
fit perfectly,
item as described,
very pleased,
the color looks different then on  a picture,
and fabric is  a little rough,
i won't recommend it to my friends,
nothing,
great t-shirts lightweight stains come out easily,
i am ordering three more for work,
like the shirts,
"this shirt is disappointing, even for the $14 price",
the fabric is essentially the same as t-shirt fabric,
construction is about the same as t-shirt construction plus a collar,
there are no side vents at the waist or flat stitching in the interior like you get on almost all other polo shirts,
"lee-brand polo shirts, also sold here on amazon, have noticeably better fabric and construction for about the same price",
love them that’s why i had bought them again for work,
great work shirts,
it is a great shirt for the price,
i ordered these for my grandson,
he has to wear collered shirts for school,
i ordered the next size up for him as he is a growing teen,
he likes the colors and the style and that's what is important,
i am happy that he is happy,
low price,
bought for my son-in-law and it was too tight in shoulders,
material very thin  will not purchase again,
i am a woman and purchased men's medium for the length since i am taller,
they fit perfectly and wash well with no shrinkage,
this shirt is made of t-shirt fabric,
i expected something a little thicker,
as described,
fit well shrunk a little,
but not too much,
still fits,
i ordered a long sleeve polo shirt and i got a short sleeve,
brother loved them,
👍🏼,
okay so i'm a girl &amp,
i work at walmart so i needed this shirt,
so the shirt it's self is awesome,
very light weight and roomy,
"my bust is 36"" &amp",
i got a medium and it fits perfectly on my body &amp,
around my boob area,
the shirt is kinda thin,
i like that about it tho cuz it's very light on your shoulders and doesn't cling to your body,
vs like the actual premium 100% cotton polos,
but for the price and the purpose of wearing it to work it's great,
i will most definitely be buying another one in white,
☺️,
nice,
great,
its ait,
well fit and nice colors,
arms slightly longer than normal,
loved the material,
"too long,",
but otherwise okay,
jeans were perfect,
great price and a perfect fit,
my husband is very happy with these polo shirts,
"the sleeves come down to almost the elbow, which is what he wanted",
"it fits true to size, not too tight or too baggy",
we will buy more of these in the future,
just ok,
happy w/ purchase,
xxl fits well,
"if this were on a scale of 1-10, it would not show up",
on the low end,
terrible shirt,
"cloth is 'see-thru', cuffs are tight, with no stretch at all",
i could say more,
"but my mother told me if i couldn't say anything nice, don't say anything at all",
there it is,
"fits, and is good quality:",
good quality,
but runs a little small,
clothes can also,
the sleeves are a little longer and need to be modified,
delivery is very fast,
"great fit sleeves dont stretch at cuff, washed it several times still stays the way if bought it great deal for money, quick delivery",
somewhat small,
great fit good price,
solid shirt for price,
perfect as always,
good product and delivery on time,
good,
great,
nice quality and fits to size,
"this shirt fits well and is comfortable,",
but it is a magnet for lint and animal hair,
"if you have animals that shed, i would reconsider",
my girlfriend loves the shirt,
cant beat this for the price,
feels comfortable and did not shrink,
the t-s*** came out way too big even when i selected the size you usually use,
"also the quality of the fabric is low, i do not think you can use more than 1 time",
arrepiendo me to have made this purchase,
pretty average smh pictures are deceiving,
horrible,
good quality and it came fast,
"my son loved it, a perfect fit",
fits great and comfortable,
it is soft and super comfortable,
according to my dad,
good quality and good fit,
"material is thin, not what i expected",
was happy with the purchase product met my expectations,
good product will order again for my company,
great shirt great seller,
too long &amp,
flimsy,
it is a good product,
"the color and size are very good, in general is ok, please have in mind is a cheap product",
i use these,
"2 of them, black and navy",
for work in cooler weather,
"for the price, you cannot beat it",
"i like them untucked to conceal a weapon and these fit perfect, just the right bit of looseness",
not as fitted as product picture implies,
"nice shirts, fit is excellent and trim",
"really nice polo, very light",
appears decent for its purpose,
school uniform,
color wrong and toto thin,
product is cheap,
"will never buy jerzee products again, sleeves were way too long, cheaply made, poor stitching, fabric is too thin",
very poor quality,
"guess you get what you pay for, have noticed that most products made in china, these days, are of very poor quality",
fits perfectly,
great shirt,
mfg,
not the quality expected,
great value,
just as promised fine product,
a little bit long of sleeve,
shirts were very small and were wasted bc of not fitting,
everything ok,
the material is very thin,
"very good shirt, especially for the price",
where else can you get a quality shirt for this price,
"only question:  how do they make the shirt body without seams?  it fits great, and looks great",
"it is a little bit large,",
"but i dont mind, it's like a sweater",
used this for a themed retirement party,
"yes, i was gilligan and the shirt was just right",
great shirt for the price,
amazing,
very good,
"nice shirts, great price",

i would purchase another product from this seller,
"smaller than st john shirt at same size,",
but cheaper,
"does not wash well, have to iron",
"excellent shirt, i bought 2 altogether",
will buy again and highly recommend this product,
the collar design is great and the hand cuffs are tight,
good quality,
but runs too large,
the quality was more than i expected for the price,
bought this for work and it's perfect for the food biz,
size too small,
"very low quality,doesn't worth that money",
price is reasonable,
very pleased,
"nice fit, comfortable",
great price,
perfect no complaints,
"i was looking for a shirt where the collar would stay flat/smooth, and not get all curled up",
"i also wanted a nicer ""hang"" of the shirt",
this was not it,
great for school uniform,
fit great and comfortable,
good material,
good fit,
"it fit a little big,",
but that's a good thing right lol,
it was comfortable and light weight thank you,

esta era de niño no de hombre,

thank you,
very low quality of fabric,
it looks cheap,
"it is confortable,",
but that m is like a xl,
these shirts perfect,
perfect sizing and perfect weight of material,
would  buy again,
it is low quality,
i should have realized that you get what you pay for,
i will never buy clothes via amazon,
i have a very bad experience with it and with this specifically,
very happy with purchase,
looks very nice,
"good value, size was good",
i was very pleased with them,
sleeves are short,
shirt shrank in the wash without going into the dryer,
fast shipment from seller,
item just didnt fit as expected,
"shirts fits well, material looks a little cheap",
nice shirt for the price,
great polo,
good quality product,
"really good,it is cheap for me",
i love it and i have bought 3 such shirts,
quality if fabric is not good,
i bought mehroon it was  loose,
items came within 9 days and it was true to size,
comfortable and really light weight,
i am completely satisfied with the product,
perfectly function,
very thin,
tee shirt like material,
not nice enough for school uniforms,
wrinkles easley,
not the same quality as last year,
very disappointed,
will not buy again,
"good value, good purchasing experience",
for the price they are great,
wash up good no fade or wrinkles,
bought 2 for work then another two a week after,
product was shipped timely,
they make great work shirts and keep dry if you're caught in the rain,
will be buying more in the future,
good quality and fit well,
it came in on time and was very happy with the product,
"thanks, would recommend to a friend",
no?,
"excellent - item delivered on time, was as described, great customer service",
"cotton shirt, fits good",
i thought it was going to be a different material,
"this will shrink after a few washes, so if you don't mind that your good",
good shirt for the money,
"great shirt for the price ,fits very good",
nice,
thank you,
great shirt for  work,
it is good taking in consideration the price,
lil small,
but i like it,
the material is very good and fits perfect,
my son loves the shirt,
"the size is wrong,",
but that's my fault,
instead of ordering medium i should have ordered a small so it can actually fit me nicely,
i could see myself wearing this if i put on 20 pounds,
but that's not happening anytime soon,
fits me well its exactly how i wanted it to be for a polo shirt,
originally looked too large,
but it shrank in the wash and was just right right,
"great fit, fast delivery, good value",
thanks,
fits great,
the shirt sent was short sleeved,
they did not have the pictured item,
my husband love his t-shirt,
the fit is perfect and the material is to die for,
thumps up great,
good price for jersey polo,
the shirt looks like the picture,
but a large is more like a triple x,
"would advise a small if you normally need a large, odd",
i like it,
i got a large,
but it is very very big,
cuffs are way too tight on these,
can't push them up my forearms at all,
also the collars tend to curl a lot,
not the best long sleeve polo i've owned,
good quality and fit for the price,
will buy more,
did not fit well,
nice,
wonderful product just as advertised,
this shirt was exactly like the picture and the color was spot-on,
it matches the color of green that dollar tree sales people wear,
nice tee shirt,
good quality for the price,
would recommend if you are looking for a cheap quick fix,
fits well and looks great,
great workshirt,
the shirt fit fine,
very good value,
i'm satisfied with it,
large was too big,
nice shirt for the price,
for the price it is a pretty good fit,
fabric feels ok,
could have been better if the colors were a bit more clear,
this shirt fit true to size and nice color,
the material is a little stiff hopefully after laundering it will be better,
comfortable to wear and didn't shrink in the wash,
brilliant,
perfect fit,
will order more in the future =,
i don't like the quality,
hector rivers,
i like these shirts,
too large,
"better quality than expected, no shrinkage after 4 washes'",
nice,
perfect fit and quality,
liitle big,
but it is ok,
"nice shirt, a little thin",
but it is excatly what i expected for the price,
i'll wear it in the office,
sleeves too tight,
great value and the fit is true to size,
i really like the shirt fit as expected,
"worn several times, washed great, no shrinkage",
very poor quality material,
already looks faded,
it is low quality,
i should have realized that you get what you pay for,
i will never buy clothes via amazon,
i have a very bad experience with it and with this specifically,
good product except fitting in size i e  to smaller tight on chest,
"size fit as expected, true red color and washes well",
excellent,
fit perfectly,
looks great,
"shirts are ok for the $, i guess",
"but are very, very thin and fade somewhat upon first washing",
i wouldn't purchase again,
very good,
very thin shirts,
like that,
material very thin,
they're of great quality,
shrunk after first wash,
good quality,
love this work shirt,
"this shirt is made of thin, poor quality, rough, and see through material",
not appropriate for work or school,
i ordered this shirt because of the many positive reviews,
i am definitely returning,
too large,
"not much to say other than the fit is as sized,",
not over big or over small to the label,
the perfect seller will the perfect size,
shirt was way smaller than it should have been,
wondering if they are in chinese sizes,
"the product was exactly as i had expected, and came quickly",
"i had to buy two for an expo, not knowing of they would  of satisfactory quality,",
"but fortunately, they were professional looking enough and did the trick",
"overall, i am very satisfied with the purchase",
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍,
thank you,
i bought it as a gift for my brother and he likes it,
did,
very very soft,
nice,
nice shirt,
great fit,
nice looking,
"got 3 different colors for work, nice price",
i will buy more as needed and i will use amazon,
love them,
warm with a good fit,
good as expected,
perfect,
great for work,
"great shirt, nice and light",
a little small,
for the money these shirts were way better than i thought,
they are very good quality,
so so,
"i used these as a uniform shirt, and was exactly what i needed",
fits exactly as it should and seems to be of good quality,
this shirt sucks,
looks like something you would buy at kmart,
i dont like to give bad reviews,
but this shirt is poor quality,
too large,
fits well,
great deal,
i m size m,
"ran just slightly small,",
but not too much so,
still comfortable and nice,
good only for cooler days,
"if its hot and warm weather, its getting me to swear more",
👍👍👍👍,
"i ordered a long-sleeve green jersey polo,  i received a short-sleeve green jersey polo",
shirt looks fine,
but not what i expected,
the delivery was super as was the shirt - i plan to replace the too large for a smaller size -  that was the only problem - and i am sure i'll enjoy wearing a smaller size - the fabric was smooth and the color just right,
cut is like a xxl,
i wear a large,
gave it to a friend who wears a 44 suit,
i wear a 40,
i would return it,
but had already washed,
good job,
fits great :,
"get for the az desert, cotton",
thanks,
poor quality,
you get what you pay for,
was a gift for god-son,
my second one,
great,
good buy - excellent value,
i am pleased with the fit  well worth the price,
i like the overall length  i bought shirts in the past that were too short,
they don't ride up when i bend over,
great value for the money,
"it is a good shirt, especially for the price",
the shirt fit well and i will probably order an extra one,
good shirt for the money,
very satisfied,
i just ordered three more,
ok quality and not very comfortable,
i guess for colder weather it could wear better,
i bought several of these to wear this fall and winter when playing golf,
the fit is perfect and allows unrestricted movement for a full golf swing,
colors are great,
great,
my husband was not happy with this selection as he was looking for more of a dress shirt for work,
stains easily not like 100% poly,
had to throw away,
didn't realize it was mostly synthetic not cotton,
after a few washes the cheap material shows through,
"purchased a large for our son, very large on him",
i guess i'll have to see if it shrinks enough to wear to school,
fit like an extra large,
wrinkles easily,
cheep,
worn 1 time and threw it away,
nice shirt good price delivered on time,
muy buen producto,
they arrived really fast,
good job,
the shirts seems just a little small around the waist than what i expected,
but not that bad,
length is excellent,
i'm satisfied,
love the brand,
good fit,
i like that it is 50% cotton /50% polyester so it won't shrink and its stain resistant,
looks great and fits nice,
"if you're overweight this should be a perfect fit,",
"but it looked like a maternity dress on me, definitely a mistake",
awesome,
sent back,
fabric thin and cheap,
very good shirt for the money,
"this shirt sized for someone large and in charge or, who needs extra room for buffet style dinning",
the material is made from a potato sack from a farm in idaho,
ok,
"literally the first day wearing them, i rolled the sleeves up a little and they ripped at the seems",
as  advertised,
i ordered a large size and items fit and look like extra large,
material of the shirts are good for everyday use,
cotton &amp,
polyester,
shirt fit as expected,
great value,
was able to add my own graphic rather easily to become a coaches shirt for my son's baseball team,
good,
"very suprised on how good the shirts fit and also how well they were made, will order more for this summer",
it was a good deal,
very inexpensive shirt and looks/ fits like it,
it's too small in some ways and too big in others,
just a really garbage shirt,
i'd say i'd wear it for yard work or something,
but its not at all comfortable,
next time my son spills something i'll probably use it to clean it up and then throw it away like a paper towel,
fits well and delivered a day early,
love it very comfortable,
"static, can not touch metal",
i want my money back,
i ordered a white polo two times,
i got the green polo two times,
does the photo look like a white polo?,
was to small for the size of large,
cheap material,
way too big,
thanks,
a good material and very comfortable i love them and i talk to my friend about them thank you,
way to large,
"arms are a little snug, i suggest getting one size bigger than you are",
not excatly how is shown on the picture,
no tag on the collar,
looks cheap,
very thin,
size is bigger than xl should be,
the black one from lee,
see the deference,
but i can use it for sleep😊,
the shirts took two weeks to get here and,
"while i got a refund, the shirts are of a very very low quality",
they are thin and you can see through them,
i have a feeling you would be able to see your undershirt through them because of the low fiber content of these shirts,
plus the seller took over two weeks to ship them to me,
"its a good thing i got a refund, because they would've been on the next return shipment back to the vendor anyway",
they also are not very long either,
fail,
good,
just want i wanted,
great,
it'd not as big as i like,
i prefer 4xlt or 5xlt,
this is poor quality t-shirt,
i'l keep it,
but its not the standardi was unticipating,
any way i don't blame anyone for that since i like it on apicture,
good,
i ordered a large and it fit like a small-medium,
comfortable,
i picked the wrong size,
it's ok,
is too small,
but write the is large,
not complaints,
great lightweight loved the color when i got it,
the color on screen didnt do the shirt justice,
i am going to order a few more for my husband,
"i needed the polo tshirt my work and it came right on time and it fits perfectly,i bought the medium size and it fit me really good,i would recommend somebody to this seller",
10/10,
the male in residence wears a large polo shirt and the large size fits perfectly,
what distinguishes the shirt from regular models is the fabric is treated with spot shield which helps repel water and other substances that may stain,
like all treated fabrics to preserve the life of the treatment laundering requires avoiding chemicals and high heat,
specifically mentioned on the fabric care instructions,
located on part of the tag-less label printed inside the shirt below the collar,
is to not use fabric softener,
"the fabric care symbols are hard to read which is why i am noting them here--the shirt should be machine washed cold, tumble dry on low, no iron, no bleach and no dry cleaning",
i measured the large shirt both before and after laundering to gauge shrinkage which was minimal,
"chest circumference at point under each arm around is 48 inches before washing, 47 inches after",
"length of the body from the top of the shoulder to the hem is 31 inches before laundering, 30 inches after",
sleeve length is 11 inches from top of shoulder to cuff both before and after washing,
the circumference of the sleeve opening was 14 inches before laundering and 13 ½ inches after,
promptly removing the shirt after drying eliminated all wrinkles,
the bottom of the shirt has a 1/2 inch hem which seems sufficient to prevent rolling and the body of the shirt itself is formed like a tube and has no seams,
since seams can rub and chafe eliminating any of them increases comfort,
"there is a loose thread in the bottom hem stitching which i suspect will be a problem if left as is, so i will need to tack that down to ensure it does not unravel",
"this may be an anomaly with the shirt i received, otherwise construction is good",
economical basic polo shirt treated to be stain resistant in a wide offering of colors and sizes,
"this shirt is for the garbage send it back to china or take it off the web i rather give my 11 dollars  to a homeless person then this shirt,the material is made from crud oil garbage and has pcb in it",
don't bother to buy this shirts,
very nice shirt for the price,
"i was amazed at how comfortable they are and the fit was excellent, even after washing",
material is light weight so they are more geared for warmer weather,
the tails are long enough to be worn untucked,
i don't particularly like my shirts snug so i ordered up a size and i'm glad that i did,
the only down side to this shirt is that there is no shirt pocket,
"overall, i'd say that you'd be pressed to find a better shirt at the price these are offered for",
this shirt is styled basically like a t-shirt with a collar,
"it seems like the quality of a shirt you would expect for a uniform in a fast food restaurant or auto repair shop, where you're dealing with messes and spills--not a shirt you would wear to the office or a nice look to wear around casually",
"it is pretty cool to watch how it sheds liquids and that should extend the life of keeping deep stains out, if laundered properly",
"i was not a fan of how it looked, and neither was my wife",
"i brought 3 green uniform with collar on it and it works great for work,",
but it is too big,
but its okay,
it will shrink later on,
i have tried to wash the green t shirt with collar and the colors did not fade off,
seven bucks for a t shirt is a great deal,
while walmart and retail stores doesn't carry green t shirt with collars on it,
"if you weigh 120 pounds, tall, skinny 5'5 small is right for you",
cause when you get medium t shirt i got has 3 m m m's on it,
it would be too big for you and the sleeves are very long to your elbow,
with this price i can't complain,
i have had the shirt for three months,
"i wanted an inexpensive, casual, lounging shirt",
"it fits that need, does not wrinkle",
even when left in the dryer for two days,
"the 50/50 blend, though, makes it somewhat ""clammy"" if you get active and sweat",
not as absorbent as a higher-cotton blend,
bottom line:  i got what i wanted for a decent price,
update,
10/2016,
:  i have raised my rating to 4-stars,
from 3,
i got a similar shirt,
from a different manufacturer,
but same price range,
with a 60/40 blend,
it is a more comfortable blend for active-wear,
"this shirt,",
"however, fits better",
"i can tell it is not going to last as long as a more expensive shirt,",
but i am fine with that,
"i am the kind of person who would rather have a new ""cheap"" shirt every four or five months and then just pitch it, rather than spending more and getting a ""expensive""  shirts that last longer,",
but then end up having a closet full of old shirts i never wear,
"cheap, decent quality, logo-less shirts are my thing, and so i give it five stars because that is exactly what i expected, and exactly what i got",
"if you like long lasting, high-quality clothing then i would suggest looking for something else and spending much more",
"however, if you are like me, then go for this one",
"unless, they raise the price over $12 bucks, then go for something else, ha ha",
i like the shirt,
for the price it’s perfect,
this jerzees men's spot shield short sleeve polo sport shirt looks good and fits well,
the shirt is perfect for casual events,
the material is good quality and has held up nicely with normal wear,
highly recommended,
cfh,
this is a very nice basic polo shirt,
it is light-weight and fits true-to-size,
i washed it in warm water and dried it on low,
it kept its shape and didn't show any appreciable shrinkage,
it is wrinkle-free if it is removed from the dryer immediately,
this is a good work shirt or project day at home shirt,
"it's not what i would call fashion wear,",
"but great for at home or a quick run to the store, similar to a t-shirt only stain resistant",
this shirt by jerzees fits exactly as expected for the size,
the fit is slightly loose and it's comfortable,
"the bands around the sleeves are not tight, and the collar isn't scratchy",
the seams are sewn evenly and seem strong,
"the fabric isn't too thin or thick,",
but it's also not as soft as we'd like,
it's not exactly rough or scratchy,
but would probably feel comfier if worn over an undershirt,
the color is bright and vivid,
"the spot shield works well to repel drips and drops, so it stays looking clean longer",
"overall, it's a very nice shirt",
"it could be softer,",
but it's still comfortable,
this shirt lives up to its name,
as someone who always pressures anymore and worries about stains prior to work,
this shirt has not,
it drys and so far no stains have been created from perspiration,
it’s also lighter in weight than most shirts of this style which i love about it as well,
the color has held up in the wash,
slight shrinkage after the first wash,
but that’s to be expected,
i will purchase again,
this does repel liquids and stains to a good extent,
i'm not sure if it is coated with something or if it is from the slightly tight weave,
"water, for instance, just bounces off unless it is a very large amount",
this effect has lasted through an initial wash and wear,
"the tradeoff, i suppose, is that the fabric is not as soft as some other brands",
it's acceptable though,
it isn't itchy or rough,
"it does fit true to size, and the styling is typical",
"there are no real surprises in the sizing, cut or color",
it is a very typical polo shirt in a bright royal blue,
the sizing for the xl,
only the xl,
is,
chest-  50 inches measured at underarm to underarm and doubled,
total length - top of folded down collar to bottom of hem- 33 inches,
sleeve width at edge-  7,
25 inches,
this is a great shirt,
"nothing fancy, and is exactly what i was hoping for",
"it fits nicely, feels nice, and goes well with my darker pair of blue jeans",
"i've worn it several times, and it hasn't seem to really shrink in the wash",
another plus,
"if you're in the market for a good quality polo without any frills, this is a safe bet",
basic long sleeve polo,
decent quality for the price,
fit loose,
"it does small bad out of plastic bag, it definitely needs to be washed before wearing",
"this is a comfortable, basic polo",
"i like the material,",
but not as much as the mercurized cotton feel of ralph lauren polos,
"my wife said it looks cheap, like a high school club polo,",
but i think that's overly harsh,
"it's a comfortable, basic polo that fits well around the shoulders and looks durable",
recommended,
perfect for me though the material its thin,
but as price for this its okay,
well it looks nice on me,
so yeah,
i approved,
the medium size is bigger than me  cause usually in tshirts im size medium so,
i returned it and get the size small,
i got this for my husband and it was way too big for him,
he is 5’-7,
5” with size 44 chest and size 42” waist,
and this large t shirt was big on him,
i’d qualify it as a classic xl fit,
color was dull,
but for ten bucks - this is a good buy,
just make sure you get one size smaller than usual,
4 stars,
"if you are looking for a fitted polo shirt, you should look elsewhere",
this shirt is way too big for it's size and the overall style is targeting 90's office clerks,
i don't think it's worth your money,
fits great,
works perfect,
thanks amazon,
i bought multiple of these for my husband when he switched to an office position and for the summer,
they were a decent price,
i got 7 for what i would have paid for 1 or 2 at the store,
", they have held up with his job and weekly washings, and there has not been color fading",
they made it through the summer and will last the warm days of fall,
they will be around next summer for him to wear as well,
"i bought 5 for my son when starting high school, and he's starting his junior year and will wear the same shirts",
"i did buy a size big for him to grow into,",
"but they have kept their color, fit, and shape",
they are light weight and not heavy like the school shirts at walmart,
love these shirts,
exsctly what i was looking for at a great price,
"for the price, it is not bad",
the blue one is actually a beautiful vivid blue,
a bit more vivid than the picture,
pretty nice for work,
"very uncomfortable, sleeves are very tight, pretty much true to size except that, i guess it’s what you get for $13",
material is thin,
but the fit was perfect,
"it wears well,",
but after i washed it in cold water w/normal dry cycle it did fit a bit more snug,
"it's a nice blue color, my favorite",
the material feels comfortable,
it's a slightly thinner material than a standard polo style shirt which is what i liked very much about the shirt,
the quality is good and the price was great,
i ordered the wrong size,
but i'd say the sizing listed is accurate,
good quality,
great fit,
very thin material,
true to size,
comfortable and looks good,
i love them,
"this shirt is a cotton/polyester mix,",
but it feels like plain cotton,
"it is very comfortable, breathes wonderfully, fits and hangs nicely",
mine is the royal blue color and it is bright without being overwhelming,
"the color is thinner than on some other polo shirts,",
but it folds down correctly,
"overall, a durable, bright, comfortable, slightly loose fitting polo shirt",
the description is accurate and the color is a nice green,
"the material is very thin,",
but it fits true to size,
good shirt,
"soft,thin and easy to clean",
pop in dryer wrinkles gone,
it doesn't shrink,
i got a extra large for my son that's what he usually wears,
he could have fit a large comfortable,
way too big so i sent them back for a refund,
good quality,
came quickly,
great shirt and comfortable,
good quality fit good,
decent shirts for the price,
i rate this 4 stars for its good value for the buck,
it is a combination of cotton and polyester and so it is practically no ironing needed,
the material is thick and sturdy,
it just looks like any regular polo shirts - nothing fancy or special,
"on the negative side, it doesn't feel very soft and somewhat scratchy",
"the fabric on this is awful, very uncomfortable, very very cheap",
not too shabby for the price,
four stars because hubby hasn't worn it much and it hasn't gone thru a wash cycle yet and i think this style of polo kind of makes hubby a touch older looking,
i love this shirt very comfortable and light,
needed it for a costume component on a very hot july day,
"the shirt fit well, stayed cool and comfortable even though i wasvery active",
would definitly reccomend this shirt in any color?,
very good value,
perfect,
exactly as described and fits well,
great shirt,
it fit fine,
"but for a long sleeve  polo the material is paper thin , summer weight not winter weight",
i guess i have to keep in mind that it was inexpensive,
it was my work shirt the long sleeves kept me warm,
i use this product for work i give it a 10,
the shirts were perfect my husband loves them,
they fit perfectly and look so nice on him and they fit true to size,
thank you,
color is vibrant red,
material very soft and comfortable,
i love these  shirts  i got them for work  it  fit  great,
the fit was perfect,
love the look,
i will be getting more of these shirts,
price is great,
i would recommend this shirt,
i have no complaints,
product is exactly how it is described,
i will order again,
low price and exactly as it should be,
this is a good quality shirt and it fit as described in the recommended sizing chart,
i like this product because not only does it fit well it did not shrink in the washer,
good material,
nicer than expected,
"fits well, hangs nicely, and fabric feels good in addition to resisting stains",
stitching looks good and straight,
bright color adds a nice punch,
great value,
this is a great shirt that fits well and is very comfortable,
great price as well,
no complaints,
it fits as expected and feels smooth and soft to touch,
"fit nice, good strong cotton, easy to wash and care for",
i got this for my boyfriend,
"it fits well and looks nice,",
but the material is a little rough,
i imagine it will soften as he wears it more,
the dickies polos have much smoother fabric,
fit well and was a nice casual shirt,
great value for the price,
great shirt and great price,
"comfortable and breathable, this is good for hot climates or out on a golf course",
it washes well and does not wrinkle easily,
fits as expected,
its quite unusual,
"but ever since i started wearing this outfit in the office, everybody wants to like go with the flow and now we all look like siblings",
i am very pleased with this product,
it's comfortable and fits perfectly,
great product and fast shipping,
fits nice and nice feel,
lightweight,
but good quality,
everything was ok,
reasonably priced and quick delivery,
as described,
"great price, great product :",
very pleased,
major thanks,
"great polo shirt, it has long sleeves and it just fits my body and style, its a perfect fit",
great,
"because my brother has unusual taste in clothing, i gave him this polo shirt as a gift and he loves it",
its ok for now,
false advertisement they are not $3,
55,
my oldest son loves his shirt,
these shirts are great and my husband loved them,
he usually wears a lot of tshirts in xl,
6'3 190lbs,
so i would recommend getting a size smaller because the large fit him perfectly,
didn't match color in picture very very light grey also is a very light material don't what i wanted or expected,
a little short for a 2x,
feels great,
have to order additional smaller size as the large is huge,
don't think i can use them,
color is nice,
a++,
fits excellent,
washed and dried and it didn't shrink,
well worth the money,
i wasn’t sure if i should or should not order because the reviews were all over the place,
but i’m glad i took the chance,
i ordered blk/lrg and it’s great,
"husband 5’11approx 175lbs, solid throughout upper back, chest and shoulders",
he loves it and i love how it looks on him,
material wasn’t thin by any means or very thick,
it was right in the middle,
but leaning a tad bit towards the thicker side and for the price it was a steal,
"it’s  been washed twice in cold, inside out and since it fits perfectly i hang it to dry instead of the dryer",
pretty simple and straightforward,
i can’t speak on if it fades much or not since it won’t be going in the dryer and it’s washed in cold,
not often you find all of those qualities in the same product so we are very satisfied,
ordering another and i’ll review again,
✌🏼,
i was lookking for work shirts i could use on the jobsite installing wood flooring,
i need some coverage in the back when kneeling and bending over and room to remain flexible,
this covered both issues and the long sleeves help protect my arms when handling materials,
well made and reasonable price,
my son works in a coffee shop and has to wear white shirts for work,
"crazy, i know",
"out of all the shirts we've tried, these are definitely the best - they stand up to the coffee abuse",
"seriously, the coffee grounds float in the air so no matter how careful his is, his clothes still get coffee-tinged",
and they come very clean when we wash them with some bleach,
shirts are very soft and comfortable - we highly recommend and plan to buy more,
this shirt was bought as a part of my son's school uniform for winter months last year,
"he has grown much since last year,",
but they still fit,
if it is taken out of the dryer right away and hung up it doesn't need ironing,
it fits the desired purpose very well,
good casual shirt,
looks good on my 77 year old husband,
he likes the warmth of the long sleeves,
work shirt,
"professional, lightweight and breathable",
great for a business casual look,
overall i am very happy with the fit of this product,
this is a sharp looking shirt,
i just wish it was softer,
my husband is 6'2 @180lbs and wears a xl,
the shirts fit perfectly they are not too loose,
good thin material,
my husband loves these,
"i got him 2 black ones for work, they fit great and didn't shrink in the wash",
perfect for work,
great quality shirts,
i had to order one more,
thanks so much,
great value for the price,
will buy again,
"nice shirt fit perfectly, did not shrink after washing",
fyi: i do not dry my shirts,
sizing ran a little small,
but i was able to work with it,
great for on the job,
i  a 4x because of my chest size and a 5x was a bit snug,
very comfortable and soft,
"perfect fit  , good for working",
happy purchase,
good fit and great color,
launders very well,
did not shrink,
"like the material, color, and hopefully it fits",
it's a present,
perfect fit,
i ordered these shirts for my son to work in and they are very reasonably priced and fit well,
will order more so he doesn't have to wash so frequently,
perfect,
big guys are hard to shop for,
you guys saved the day,
he looked nice,
excellent,
great fit and very comfortable would recommend if asked,
perfect for packing in care on luggage,
nice,
helps keeps me warm,
while at work,
fit as it said it would and a very nice shirt,
will purchase more in future,
good material vibrant colors,
"fit, color and texture are fine",
like the quality and fit of the shirt,
i think i bought the tall size,
just as advertised,
everything prefect for florida,
really nice shirt,
fits greet,
looks great on,
just like advertised,
like it,
incredible,
good quality,
husband loves it,
very well made and fit perfect,
recommended,
fits great,
happy,
love it,
nice shirt,
it's comfortable,
a large fits my 212 lb fat body,
and it looks good on me,
exelent good size perfect,
"good material, and fit well",
my teenager is growing so tall,
he is out of his 18/20 shirts he has a long torso,
adult small it is,
the length of the shirt is long,
but it doesn’t look bad,
fit perfect,
this is a great shirt,
it fits well and was shipped quickly,
"fit right, well made, great price",
good,
nice,
just how i like wearing my shirts,
"esta franela no me llegó y no sé cómo hacer que me hagan el reembolso, puse que lo devolvía pero es que no me ha llegado y al parecer di a entender que lo tuve alguna vez y no es así",
"good fit, material and stitching is nice",
i liked the fit,
no shrinkage so far,
good work  shirt,
color fit feel,
this polo is literally see through and does not fit at all,
do not get this polo,
i will buy it again,
"the color is perfect, goes with many pieces in my wardrobe and fits like a dream",
washes and dries perfectly,
"i'll be able to layer it for the winter, too",
"it came on time, looks great and is well worth the price",
"back in the days of wearing a suit to work, it was always easy to get the correct size for an office shirt",
these are given by collar size,
"apparently, get that correct and somehow the chest and back-length are correct too",
"but for casual wear, these are only given by rough chest size",
for me that would be size m,
"however, i am tall and slim and m means it is too short for [back] length",
and the collar size is still totally hit and miss,
a loose collar is no good here in the uk,
"i solve the length problem by buying a cheap t-shirt of the same size, cutting off about 4 inches of the bottom and attaching it to the first shirt with hem-tape",
"anyway, the m-size of this shirt is just right for me",
"long enough in the back – no hem taping here, just about ok collar size",
perhaps a tiny bit loose,
but acceptable,
the shirt also has a good close fit around the wrists and is soft and comfortable to wear,
i guess you can't expect much more considering the price,
"pay 1/6th the price of a gap polo shirt, you're gonna get 1/6th the material, and thats kinda what it feels like",
"but it you are lookgin for a light summer t-shirt with a collar and don't want to care about accidently ruining an expensive shirt, this is a recommended ""go to""",
"i think these jerzees will become my ""around-the-house-dad"" shirts",
"son de buena calidad , llegó justo cuando se dijo que llegaría",
"si buscas una camisa polo ajustada, esta no es tu opción, es un poquito más larga que las comunes pero realmente luce muy bien",
when these arrived,
arrived really fast,
", i was a little concerned that they were a cheap shirt",
"price was cheap,",
but not necessarily the quality of the shirt itself,
"the shirt appears to be a little thin when i removed it from its bag,",
but the shirt when worn is not really that thin in actuality,
"the thin appearance when holding it up is just that in my opinion, an appearance",
what it does do is lets the shirt breath extremely well allowing you to remain cooler than expected on warm days,
while at the same time keeping you warm on cooler days,
"bought two of these, one in green and one in black and am really happy with my purchase",
curious to see how the color holds up after a few washes,
"évidemment, à ce prix la qualité n'est pas ''supérieure'' mais j'adore ces polos",
j'en ai 5 identiques de 5 couleurs différentes parce qu'ils ne sont pas chers,
je les recommande fortement à tous ceux qui aiment ça être vêtus ''décontractés'',
"pour quelqu'un qui pèse 170 livres, comme moi, il faut un xl",
i ordered a medium,
but when i tried it on it fit too large,
shirt hung down well below my waist and the sleeves went down to my elbow,
"it’s a nice enough shirt, nice color, looks sharp",
just fit too large so i returned it,
prospective buyers might want to consider ordering a size smaller,
"el único inconveniente es que la talla l está muy grande, a mi parecer parece más como talla xl",
de lo demás todo bien,
"i'm on the edge of small and medium size, so depending of the shirt, polo, t-shirt, i would say that medium is usually my best fit,",
but sometimes small is ok,
"so after reading some of the reviews, i was concerned by the medium size being too large for me",
i don't like to wear too tight clothes,
"so i ordered a medium size and for me this polo shirt is just perfect, giving me enough room to be comfortable, without looking too large",
"the fabric is nice, soft and confortable,",
but not very thick,
"this for me is perfect, because thick fabric polo shirts are not as confortable",
"also, thick fabrics tend to be warmer, which i don't need for a summer polo",
finally the color is perfect and the price just great,
these shirts are really comfortable and the darker colours look quite sharp,
"they're basically high quality, long sleeve t-shirts with a collar",
"they wash well, with little wrinkling,",
but don't dry them too long in the dryer,
i'm a big guy who is somewhere between xl and 2xl,
"the 2xl fits me perfectly so if you're not too sure, get the larger size",
i'm buying more,
"wish they had a dark, charcoal grey",
all good except material feels a bit too synthetic - needs more cotton,
may soften up with a couple washings,
then again it may last longer than cotton,
muy bonita se ajusta perfecto el color es como el que se muestra en la fotografia no duden en comprar,
we ordered an xl and it was true to size,
the fabric is thin and light,
sadly,
"it says it’s 50/50 cotton/poly preshrunk fabric,",
but it shrunk a couple inches at the bottom only,
"it went into a warm dryer, not hot",
but it’s it’s preshrunk that shouldn’t matter,
we didn’t need a crop top,
amazon was gracious and did a return,
"la calidad no es suprema pero es bastante decente, es sport cómo se puede observar, el color es tal cual se muestra en las imágenes de la publicidad",
"consejo revisen bien las tallas en internet, cotejen con la suya y posteriormente vengan a elegir el producto de su conveniencia para evitar errores en su pedido",
"i ordered medium size,",
but what i received is triple m,
larger than medium size,
i like the quality,
but i want actual size,
i need to order large quantities in 3 different sizes,
but i don't want them triple sizes,
"no mmm, no sss or lll or xl",
"i would recommend these shirts,the same in a mens clothing store are more money",
only thing i dont understand is why the black and blue in these same shirts are more expensive,
if they where the same price as this one i purchased i would for sure have purchased both the other colours,
"other reviewers describe this as a lightweight, oversized shirt, and that is precisely the reason i bought it",
"this polo shirt held its colour and shape, when it was washed",
i would recommend to people looking for something comfy to wear with leggings or pajama pants,
"no recomendable para áreas calurosas, aun cuando es delgada la tela no se siente la misma sensación que con una camisa de algodón",
"la talla queda perfecto, el color es exacto al de la descripción, pero la calidad de la tela es muy mala muy delgada, no la recomiendo",
it fits okay,
i will see after i wash it because it's itchy with the starch in the fabric,
the cuffs are a little tight around the wrist,
i was advertised that it was tagless in the product review,
but it wasn't,
i had to cut the tags off,
pain,
"excelentes playeras yo las compré para el uniforme del trabajo, las uso a diaria y se han despintado lo normal debido al uso pero muy poco, tela fresca y cómoda además de ligeras pero de buena calidad",
la compré como regalo para un hombre de 1,
"75 mt, 75 kg, compré talla mediana y le quedó muy bien",
"el corte es recto, no es fit ni nada de eso, así que se ve un poco informal",
el color tal cual como en la descripción,
"recibí el producto correcto, talla correcta, color correcto",
muy feliz yo y la persona del regalo,
la calidad del algodón deja mucho que desear,
"obvio es una camisa muy económica, así que obtienes lo que pagas",
sinceramente mejor pagar un poco más por algo de mejor calidad,
"for such an inexpensive shirt, this more than met my expectations",
the 50/50 cotton poly blend is great because it doesn't shrink in the dryer to the ridiculous extent that 100% cotton does,
nice quality and well made,
i'll be buying for my growing sons,
"un buen producto, relación precio calidad buena",
recomendable,
"la descripción del producto no especifica el corte, no es corte regular, es slim fit",
"la tela es muy delgada y es casi transparente, muy pobre calidad, pero por el precio no se puede esperar más",
"parece ropa desechable, no la recomiendo",
"la playera polo está bien, viene un poco grande regularmente soy xl y pedi l y me quedo muy bien,  recomiendo que si van a pedir, pidan una talla más chica a la acostumbrada, la tela está delgada, muy agradable para ambientes cálidos,  recomendado",
"fit is okay, roomy enough, except for wrists where it is too tight",
can understand why reviewers have complained shirt rips at wrist,
material is rather thin,
"shirt is 50/50 cotton and polyester, not really soft",
overall impression is shirt is cheaply made to achieve a lower selling price,
better options out there,
the color and the fit are great,
but the fabric is very thin,
maybe ok for the hot summer days,
but not for the other 3 seasons,
i don't think it will last very long,
but the price is good so it is your call,
"this was just a shirt for work, and it fits, feels and looks just fine",
will probably buy another,
i ordered 14 of the white polo shirts and there is no way to return the items back,
the quality of the shirts are very poor with it being see through and the size is too large for what is advertised,
"i've tried to contact amazon customer service as well as the seller,",
but they all said that the items are not eligible for returns,
"i'm not sure what to do with these shirts now, which makes it a complete waste of money",
extremely disappointed,
"la playera es de muy buena calidad, no es ni muy ligera ni muy gruesa, la verdad es que no esperaba mucho pero me encantó",
volvería a comprarme otra así,
el color negro se ve muy bien,
súper playeras,
al principio tenía mis dudas ya que nunca había comprado esta marca pero me sorprendí al usarlas como dice la publicación no se moja le,
cae agua y quedan las,
gotas en la playera y se ven muy resistentes y de buena calidad volveré a pedir en varios colores,
"me gustó mucho, sólo tuve que comprar una talla menos a la que necesitaba, ya que es amplia",
realicé devolución de mi primer compra en talla m y posteriormente compré la talla ch,
es bonita,
hola es difícil encontrar en tiendas tallas extras llego mi playera y estoy feliz 😁 me queda perfecta y para la gente que no encontramos tallas de nuestra medida cuando encuentras algo q te queda tan bien hasta tu auto estima sube yo lo recomiendo ya compre otras 3,
"the arms and shirt body are long for a 5'8"" person",
but overall a nice shirt,
would be the perfect shirt for a taller person,
nice shirt,
"i'm 5'9 and 180 ,got an xl just to have a tiny bit more room as i don't like tight fitting collared shirts",
lightweight and fits perfectly,
"love the sleeve and shirt length, this will look good jeans",
can wear with or without an under t shirt too,
good value and plan on buying more for work and those colder days,
i am a bigger guy,
but this shirt was way too big for my liking,
"i wear 2xb or 3x depending on the brand, this shirt seems to be a very generous 3x",
muy buena camisa,
me quedó perfecto,
mido 1,
"80, peso 80kg, complexión delgada",
pedí la talla mediana y me quedó muy bien,
recomendado ampliamente,
"i haven't washed it yet, so i don't know how much it shrinks",
it seems to be good quality and is comfortable,
"it's slightly larger than i expected,",
but still fits ok,
that also leaves a bit of extra shrinkage room,
"grande qualité,  très content",
wow la grande qualité de ces t-shirt je suis impressionné,
je vais en acheter d’autres très prochainement,
lo único que no me gusta tanto es que la tela es delgada,
"no demasiado, pero sí podría ser mucho mejor",
"me quedó bien, es cómoda",
me compraré otra,
"the size is larger than advertised, i was looking for a more fitted look",
i suppose the cut has something to do with it,
"there is nothing wrong with the quality, for the price you pay you get a good value",
material is thin and make this polo better suited to warm temperatures,
"great shirts, fit well, breathable material that doesn't show sweat marks easily",
perfect work shirts,
perfect work shirts,
"i usually wear large,",
"but this large feels like an xlarge, i recommend getting one size below what you usually wear",
muy larga de cuerpo y mangas,
muy ancha tambien,
el material es como de playera,
muy delgada,
no lo se,
debi pedir la talla mediana,
quisas mi opinion hubiera sido diferente,
the shirt fit perfectly and since my size wasn't available in any retail store at the time ever seen it in the bag it was very handy when i needed it for work on short notice,
nice comfortable polo shirt,
soft cotton/polyester material,
should hold up well after washing,
sizing is correct,
very pleased with this purchase,
"this shirt finally arrived, i ordered 2 shirts 1 came on time and the other took forever",
the quality is great and for a great price,
i would definitely reorder,
"la tela de la playera es delgada, fresca y comoda",
viene mas larga de lo normal,
en relacion al precio esta bastante bien,
this is the worst shirt i have ever bought,
material is cheap and not soft at all and almost transparent,
the fit is way too big,
the worst of all it cannot be returned,
"it goes directly in the trash bin, will not even use it as a rag",
fits as expected,
material doesn’t gather lint,
wrist elastic holds,
arms aren’t too long,
may order another one,
"it was very comfortable,",
but you should wash it before you put it on mainly because it gives you a bit of a head ache,
it also came before excpected,
"aparte de la buena calidad, tamaño, corte y varios colores, no se puede encontrar en otros lugares a este precio",
wasn't expecting the best quality,
but it was pretty good aside from it being a little bit thinner than your store bought,
it is perfect for a summer shirt,
il fait très bien à mon mari qui est six pieds,
"il le porte souvent, il aime le vert",
le polo se lave bien,
bon achat,
prix vraiment raisonnable,
"normally i wear xl,",
but this shirt in l fits perfect,
feels good and fits well,
washes well too,
"6' tall with 19 inch neck, hefty fellow,",
xxl fit's great with room to move,
soft and comfy,
recommended,
great shirt for the price - still like new after 2 washes with no shrinkage ordered 2 more,
no fue lo que esperaba,
tanto el color como el corte parecian un tanto deprimidos,
desafortunadamente lo que le resto todo es que las mangas venían con calados diferentes,
hice la devolución y en un día tuve la bonificación en tarjeta de regalo,
"good colouring and material, fits a tad bigger then expected",
but that's okay i prefer my clothing loose,
they must've done something right because i bought 3 of em,
this is very nice considering the price,
but it does fit a bit small,
the 4x fit like a 3x for my son,
he still can wear it,
but not sure after it gets washed,
fingers crossed,
very comfortable and light weight,
does not deform or shrink in wash,
good value for the price,
"nice shirt,  i'm a big guy and it's tough sometimes finding nice cloths",
delivered quickly,
"aún cuando la tela es delgada se vé de buena calidad, ajusta de acuerdo a la medida anunciada, amolda muy bien",
"la playera esta padrísima, la tela muy fresca para el cuerpo",
solo que las mangas vienen muy largas,
i'm 6 foot 260 lbs got a 3xl and fits baggy a bit,
"but fits my kid who's 6'1"" 285 nice",
"grandeur correcte, confortable",
comme je le voulais et livré en temps,
"thank you very much for my order, it arrived on time and exactly what i was looking for",
the overall fit and quality of these polo shirts is amazing,
thank you again and i am sure i will be ordering more in the very near future,
"regards,",
peter,
"i purchased several of these in the past, and now i purchased more, because the quality is excellent",
para el precio que tiene este polo me pareció excelente la calidad con la que cuenta,
las medidas por lo menos en mi caso son correctas,
la calidad de la tela es buena y el color coincide con el de la imagen,
en pocas palabras es un polo sencillo y bien hecho,
well i guess i should have expected cheap &amp,
small cause that's what i paid,
correcta relación precio-calidad,
el color verde es lindo,
"queda un poco más grande de lo normal, no mucho",
"la talla es correcto queda muy bien excelente relación de calidad y precio, aunque la tela es un poco delgada",
good enough weight to hold shape and pleased with the purchase for a gift,
i have not been able to test the stain resistant properties yet,
but the shirts are very comfortable,
bought these for my husband on another recommendation and i was pleasantly surprised with both the quality and the sizing,
these were true to size ordered a large and they fit well,
will definitely order more of this brand in the future,
great polo shirt for the price,
i doubt that you could find equal quality anywhere else,
"having purchased 3 of these previously, we ordered another as a christmas gift",
we were very surprised when the recipient unwrapped it and showed it off,
it was a short sleeve version,
same cut and material as previous long sleeve ones,
"fits well although the sleeves bulky, california blue isn't that great, would not recomend",
i liked this jersey,
fit very well,
the only major problem is there is lately a fold in the front of the shirts that runs vertically in the centre from the neck down,
"i have had 5 different shirts, all with the same flaw",
great fit,
great feel,
looks great,
no to heavy,
fit is great,
"me quedó como esperaba por la talla, la tela es buena, cómoda, fresca y aparentemente resistente",
feliz con mi camisa nueva,
me quedo a la perfección,
muy buena la calidad de la tela,
lo recomiendo ampliamente,
sleeves are excessively long relative to body size,
product is not colour fast,
it bled in second wash destroying another shirt,
"la tela es muy delgada, sin embargo la talla está bien al igual que el color",
a nice inexpensive long sleeve shirt,
"fits as expected, no flaws",
la playera es amplia y las mangas son mas largas de lo habitual,
"no esperaba que el producto fuera de tan baja calidad, la tela se transparenta al ser blanca y al tacto no es suave sin duda no volveria a comprar de esta marca",
2x fits more like a 3x,
hoping it will shrink in the wash,
i doubt i’d buy this again,
it is a nice light weight cotton shirt,
great value and fit,
"buena calidad, colores firmes aún después de lavarla, excelente precio",
shirt fit as i thought,
fitting and lenght is good,
fabric is think,
i have a little experience of garment industry,
price with that kind of fabric is little expensive,
i wouldnt pay more than $9,
99,
but service was very fast and fitting is good,
le polo est vraiment bien fait et la grandeur est parfaite,
my husband loves this shirt,
it is lightweight and fits great,
his favourite colour is red,
great score,
buena calidad de tela,
"excelente para el día a día, sobre todo si buscas algo cómodo para trabajar con buena vista",
quality is poor,
the company does not do returns  or exchanges,
"justo como la esperaba, de buen material y sobre todo ajusta perfecto",
very nice quality and perfect fit,
better than i expected,
"good fit,",
"but cheap material, which is expected",
"good shirt to throw on for work in the morning, depending on the job you have",
"muy buen producto, desafortunadamente viene más grande de lo esperado",
"très satisfait mais j'iai du le retourner trop perit, j'ai recommendé une grande plus grande",
"j'ai reçu le chandail à temps pour noël, la taille était parfaite et le tissus de bonne qualité pour le prix",
excelente producto tal cual se esperaba y no se ensucia de líquido ya que lo repele,
talla exacta,
color que no se despinta,
y grata calidad,
"es de material delgado, crei que era tela gruesa, le quedó un poco holgada a la persona",
"no justa, cómoda",
un poco delgada de la tela pero muy comoda,
"chandail de travail c est ok, qualité ordinaire, mais confortable malgré tout",
confortable,
et convient bien à la grandeur choisi,
cómoda y ajuste adecuado pero el material es regular,
i bought this shirt over a year ago to wear to work in the fall/winter/spring,
it's a good quality comfortable shirt that washes well and air drys nicely,
las mangas  estaban muy largas y el resto correcto,
es buen producto pero hay que pedir  una talla menos,
too small across waist --cuffs too snug,
djh,
purchased it for my father for christmas,
looks great on him and he is comfortable,
was hoping to find a long sleeve with a pocket as that’s what my dad likes,
but had no luck,
although no pocket this is a nice shirt,
fit as expected and a good blend so  not over-wrinkly out of the wash like a lot of shirts are,
"soy un hombre grande, peso mas de 140 kg y mido 1,75 aprox, siempre tuve problemas de encontrar algo bien hecho y que me quedara",
"finalmente lo encontré super producto, lo recomiendo",
i  washed it many times already and it doesn't lose its shape,
i only wish that the color was more darker,
"el corte es perfecto, la tela delgada, haciendo un análisis entre costo beneficio, podría decir que es válida la calidad",
agradable el color y la tela,
shirt fit was true to size,
material is fine and about what you can expect for cost,
"belle qualité, confortable et grandeur parfaite",
comfortable,
but not all  seams  sewn,
poor workmanship,
"material sencillo pero se ven de buena calidad, las tallas vienen muy amplias, te sugiero pedir una más chica de la que normalmente usas",
por el precio creo que es buena opción eso sí creo que las medidas son de eu por que pedí l y me queda como xl de ahí en fuera es un buen producto,
great fit - well made shirt,
thank you,
"tela de algodón muy comoda, bonitp color",
ajuste perfecto,
se ve de buena calidad la tela,
not bad nice shirt don’t have to break bank,
fits great,
good quality,
doesn’t shrink after washing,
"very comfortable, well fitting polos and priced affordably for multiple shirts",
"very comfy and stylish, true to size as well, which was great",
nothing flashy or fancy,
just a nice/ well manufactured golf shirt at a good price,
muy buen producto,
saludos,
was ok,
nothing special,
you get what you payed for,
but might find better value on a sale or clearance item somewhere,
es muy buena calidad y se siente bien traerla puesta,
"lo único que no me gusta es que se siente un poco mas grande de lo normal, pero nada de que preocuparse",
es buen precio por la prenda,
fabric feels very thin and cheap,
"for the price, it's alright,",
but wasn't the quality i was expecting,
returned,
"tres bon achat, tres bonne qualité",
"se ve bien el producto, talla chica es por q estas delgado y te quedara muy bien",
jerzees pourhomme spot shield à manche court,
a perfect polo shirt,
"feels a little thin,",
but size is perfect and colour is great,
muy bonito y de muy buena calidad,
"excelente justo lo que compre 100% recomendable, tiempo y costo",
good value for the money and fits great,
comfortable and fits perfectly,
"la verdad esperaba un poco más de calidad, la relación del precio es un poco mayor a la calidad",
"la prenda esta como mal diseñada, no esta proporcional a la talla, es decir de lo largo y ancho si queda bien, pero las mangas estan casi igual de anchas que la parte ancha de la camisa",
"muy buena calidad, gruesa y suave",
"esta holgada del los brazos , de ahí todo lo demás está perfecto",
body length is long which is hard to find,
good quality for the price,
muy útil para tiempos fríos,
"great shirt, fits perfectly",
awesome for the price,
bought a 2nd one,
muy mala calidad,
es tan delgada que se transparenta la playera interior blanca,
la tela es de buena calidad y el color es como el que aparece en la foto pública,
"exexcecelente producto, con colores vivos y un ajuste perfecto",
tiene buena calidad pero la talla viene un poco más grande de lo esperado,
"the shirt has a very nice material and colour does not come out, i think it's pretty cool even though on the hands it's a little bit too long",
me,
gusto mucho las dos que pedí me quearo,
"ala perfección la tela es ligera, perfecta para el uso diario",
el color me gusto y el corte bueno,
buena calidad me gusto,
"mala calidad, pero por el precio no se puede exigir mucho",
great quality and fit,
thin,
but ok for casual use,
"la calidad es buena comparada con el precio, la talla esta perfecto por el corte que tiene que es amplio y pues esperemos que dure un buen tiempo",
fits as advertised,
bonita y acordé al precio,

mo me gustó que tengas muy poca variedad de colores,
sleeves a little long,
"el tiempo de tela es muy delgado y el cuello no es tejido, la calidad no es la que esperaba",
"as described, very comfortable",
itchy material that makes me a bit uncomfortable overtime,
it is made with low quality materials,
it should cost maximum 5$,
"la calidad de la playera es buena, y me quedo bien",
"no lo use, lo tuve que devolver porque me quedaba muy grande pero se veía de buena calidad",
it is long as i like,
it does not look good on me,
lo esperado precio calidad,
"es delgada la tela, es traslucida",
más lo entiendo por el precio,
excellent all the way,
they are very nice,
too small fit and not as comfortable,
a little over priced,

sleeves are a little tight,
but the material is so nice,
my boys love them,
