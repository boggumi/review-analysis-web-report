i first noticed these shirts at a country concert in october 2019 in el paso,
seemed like everyone was wearing it,
"i must have been missing the new ""it thing""",
it caught my attention when i saw the words along the sleeve of a shirt,
which are my favorite kind of shirts,
i hate when a customer has to pay for a $40 t shirt that just has a logo in the small upper corner of the shirt,
no design,
example: those marc ecko shirts with the rhino design printed on the front,
we had to pay $40 to $50 dollars for a shirt with little detail,
anyway the reason i gave it 1 star is because the shirts were huge and over sized,
i even got a small and it was still over-big,
the shirts fit like those basic scrubs that are shaped like squares,
"the bigger the size a person gets, the more square it gets",
doesnt get longer at the end of the shirt,
it's a new day in age where people wear their cloths fitted,
or brands of dress shirts have a fitted version on the shirt,
seems like the brand ariat is made for people with huge stomachs,
and they wanna keep it that way,
because they only want a certain type of people to wear their cloths,
"now that i mention it, it's so obvious",
now i know why people make their own brands,
sorry this turned into a rant instead of a review,
someone please steal my idea a d make a brand where the logo uses the sleeve and other parts of the shirt,
that would be the theme,
clever i know,
lmfao,
this shirt was a gift for my big brother who apparently wears clothes beyond my price range because this shirt ain't cheap,
beautiful shirt fit well,
just ready to find a place to wear it in,
i'm proud of it,
super shirt with wonderful material,
the only thing that would make this better is permanent press,
very nice quality shirt,
"i love the shirt, i’m fat",
"but i had forgotten on ariat dress shirts like this i fit good on a large and i wasn’t paying attention and bought an xl, and it was just way too big and i’m 5’6 about 207 if your about my size get a large",
"perfect fit for my 6'6"" son",
great looking shirt,
as expected from lariat,
fit perfect,
"awesome shirt, fits better than expected",
nice quality very thick,
wonderful shirt made with very high end material,
needs touch up pressing after dryer,
looks great just fits a little baggy,
this brand of shirt is the only brand i buy,
they starch up and press out real good,
this shirt was just too long in the sleeve,
i will order again,
but one size smaller,
wish they had more colored logo shirts,
i love the solid color shirts,
exactly as described,
soft material,
looks very nice on,
"great stylish shirt, love it",
"i've already ordered another, in different color",
very nice shirt will make a great christmas gift,
runs big,
exchanged for a smaller size,
looked amazing on him and the quality it’s better than i expected,
love it,
great,
fit absolutely perfect,
fits great looks great,
love the shirt,
just fits very tall men,
it does not come in a regular large or xl,
excellent shirt,
good quality,
fit as advertised,
i bought two,
nice shirts,
love the shirt,
everything i expected,
"however, in my opinion shirt runs a little big",
but not too much,
my favorite shirt by far that i own,
it was a little to big,
fit great and the shirt looks sharp,
nice,
perfect,
would buy again,
the logo on the sleeve looks great,
thanks,
