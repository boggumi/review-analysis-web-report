  I went out with this sweet ass shirt. Before I knew it, I had a harum of adoring women and cats fighting for their lives to bed me. I'm not that type of guy, so I rounded up some stray dogs, a jar of peanut butter, and the rest is none of your business. Just buy the shirt dude.

  Got this shirt for a wedding. I am 180lb and 5'10''. I got a large and it fit perfectly. My neck is 16 1/2  - 17.<br>PROS:<br>- very good fit<br>- very nice material<br>- had the wedding outside in very hot FL and I didn't sweat in it<br>- comfortable<br>- good price<br>CONS:<br>- a few loose annoying threads hanging at the sleeve and other seams. I cut them with small scissors

  GF bought me a different shirt to wear to a party, but I didn't like it - got this in before the party, put it on for her, and she liked it more than her choice's fit and color.  I like it, too.

  I followed their recommended sizing and ordered a medium taking a chance on it being small since they said it runs small. It came in a 42, which is not a medium and although they attached a medium tag, the shirt was large. And in their pictures it looks like a narrow athletic waist and below, but actually flares out a little. Not like the picture at all.

  This is a really great shirt, i’m 511 and  weigh 190 and extra lage is perfect for Me. I just wish it was just little bit longer because every now and then I find myself keep  having to tuck in my shirt. Other than that no complaints.

  Loved the material and the color was as shown.  Great looking shirt for the price range.  Just be sure to get 1 size larger than you normally wear.  Yes, I was aware it was slim fit when I purchased it/.

  Awesome shirt.  I actually have the white and light blue versions of this shirt.  The quality of these shirts is better than some I've purchased at department stores.  Arrived neatly folded and was easy to iron.  I wish they added a light yellow version of this shirt.

  Great material and it’s not see through.
"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Pretty much fit exactly how I thought it would, even with plenty of room in the neck and I have a lot of trouble with that on button up shirts. The feel of the material is great too. Really impressed with such a moderately priced shirt.
"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I am 6'2"" and vary between 190-200lbs and I purchased a medium. This fit me perfectly. I am the type of person that pays to get shirts fitted and I have been leaning more towards these stretch shirts because they are so cheap and look so nice. If it breaks, I replace it with another one. It's cheaper that buying a $100 shirt and paying $35 for a good tailor. A little tight around the neck but aren't all dress shirts suppose to be in order to look really good? Pulled slightly at the buttons if I lift my hands above my head but nothing to worry about. Overall, awesome shirt
"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Fantastic fit! It fit me like a glove... dad bod to athletic build(basically muscles under flab lol) super soft as well. My favorite part is I can never find a size that fits my larger neck, with a large Adam's apple but not be baggy in the waist. Usually larger necks are larger sizes all around. Not in this case! Larger neck in average sizes! I will definitely buy more from this brand!
"

  I like the look and material, good price as well. However, I’m a tall 6’1” and weight about 225 lbs, and the XL was still a little snug. Sleeves were a tad bit too short. Considering getting another one just because I do like the appearance and price, however, I’m hesitant given that this is the largest shirt they sell.
"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I ordered large which is my usual size for a dress shirt that I wear with a suit. This large shirt was a little more snug but I didn't mind because I'm wearing this shirt with casual clothing like chino pants, jeans, etc.
"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Fits great. Only downside is.. in the photo this looks like a regular genuine white button up dress shirt, yet the item received is a different material than expected and isn’t apart of my work uniform. I will still wear outside of work as it is very comfortable.

"

  It's not quite tailored in the waist section.  Great quality, elegant, formal, casual, easy to iron, you don't need an undershirt.  I used this shirt for a modern tuxedo.  I highly recommend this shirt.
"
2.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Ordered my usual size and the shirt fit fine. The fabric has the synthetic shine which I don't like, but I like the pale blue color and richer ribbed texture. I've only worn it a few times and it is ready for the trash. Some spots on the fabric look like someone took sandpaper to it with no explanation. Overall a waste of money. Other shirts in this price range are a better choice.
"
3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  My son is a medium in everything,  with some things being a little large and others being a little small.  I got him a large in this based on reviews.  It was amazingly too small.  The arms and length were way too short,  and he could barely button it. Seems like a nice shirt,  but the sizing is way off.
"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  It really is a nice dress shirt. Pay attention to the measurements.
"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  Pleasantly surprised by this shirt. I'm 6'1, wear a 42 jacket, and the large fit well. I got white and it's not see through. Fabric quality is good with cool ribbing texture. Very basic dress shirt. Better for jeans or khakis and a casual jacket, not with dress slacks imo. I like slim/tailored/athletic cut dress shirts, and liked how this shirt looked on me right away. I'll be getting more.

  This is a slim fitted shirt. I was not expecting it to be a sort of ribbed material, but it does add a little bit to they style. If you are a guy with large arms and forearms.. this one may not be for you, unless you want to hulk out of the shirt. I bought a large and it hugs around the arms.

  Zero stars. When I opened the outer package, it looked as though the shirt was dirty. I proceeded to open the sealed inner package and discovered the “dirt” was actually mold!!

  Nice material but runs small. I am 6’ 190 and it’s tight a tight across the chest and back in a large. Also, a little short as there’s not much extra material to keep it tucked in.

  My son likes slim fitted shirts, and he looked real good in this shirt. I don't like the fact that I have to wash it and iron it.

  Fits as expected. I knew it might be slightly big on my son... He is in the last leg of kids clothes and the first stage of men sizes... Thought this slim fit shirt would be my fitted. either wat he likes it but I would've preferred a closer fit because it's going under a suit.... I'm satisfied though..

  A friend of mine brought me this shirt for my Light Yagami cosplay and it fits perfectly! It’s not too big a d it’s not too small. Everything from the neck to the waist fits as expected! I’m 5’4 and 117lbs so he ordered me a small, but it feels as if this shirt was tailored specifically for me! 10/10!

  I’m a woman and purchased this for myself as I like the over-sized look. I figured since it’s a ‘slim fit’ it wouldn’t be too big, which I was definitely correct. It’s a very nice, soft shirt. However, not like your typical cotton dress shirts. It’s a little thicker. Probably great for sweaty guys so it doesn’t show, but I found it made me hotter. Eitherwise, it is definitely a slim fit, and fit my frame. I’m 5’8”.

  I was surprised by the item, not buying men's clothing online prior. My husband normally buys a large because his neck is wider than a medium allows comfortably, but he had switched the size to medium without my knowledge and the shirt fit wonderfully. It fit to his body without excess material around the back and arms while having good space in the collar for him. Having been losing weight, his belly is a wee rounder than his frame normally would have, but the shirt fit without being tight there and would stay a nice shirt once slimmed properly. So to say it fit as expected is rather spot on. Needed a medium, fit into a medium.

  I ordered a large as I read that these fit small but that was not the case. I ordered my normal size (M) and it fit much better. Feels higher quality than those cheap mall store brand.

  It is very good product, I bought medium light blue aize 42 , it is a liiiitle tight because I am a little chubby now( I should loose my weight I am 94 kilo 175 cm)<br>I am going to order another with one size bigger. and I will keep this one.<br>The quality is soft when you touch it  and slim (not super slim that I dont like it).It is little thick in good way. I dont like some when you wear your body skin be visible<br>I recommand to buy it if you are not sure but make sure your size.

  This is a really great shirt super great material. Could have used a little more work on the stitching some of the stitching was coming out but all in all it was a great shirt. Unfortunately we gave it to our friend because my fiance did not fit it. There should be more sizes available extra large was not big enough.
