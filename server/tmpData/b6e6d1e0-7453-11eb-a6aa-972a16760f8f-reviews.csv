  We purchased 3 of these shirts for my son. All the same brand, all the same size, all from Amazon, but I did a review on each color because they do differ.  I don’t know if everyone is like me or not, but I heavily rely on product reviews when placing online orders.<br><br>Purchase #1 of 3 WHITE...<br>RUNS REALLY BIG!<br><br>My son started a new job at one of the chain hardware stores. They require that he wear a collared shirt.  He didn’t have any and being that he works in the Garden Center, I knew they would get dirty and didn’t want to spend a lot.  We ordered 3 of these shirts from the same brand.  This particular one is WHITE.  I am not very happy with this one.  The material is super thin and it is scratchy.  You can almost see through it, but it works ok because he wears a vest over the shirt at work.  I will say on a positive note though, the shirt has gotten pretty dirty and has cleaned up well.  For $9.00, I probably wouldn’t buy again, I will wait for a sale at one of the department stores and get a better, softer quality shirt.<br>_________________________________<br>Purchase #2 of 3 ASH GREY...<br>RUNS PRETTY TRUE TO SIZE!<br><br>As mentioned in my other shirt review, my son is required to wear a collared shirt at work.  Being that he works in a hardware store, we knew they would get dirty and didn’t want to spend a lot.  We ordered 3 of these shirts from the same brand.  This particular one is GREY.  Out of the 3 we purchased, this one is far the best.  It is made of thicker material than the white one.  It is way softer than the white one AND it fits more true to size than the white one.  It has always amazed me how you can buy multiple items from the same seller and they fit differently.  He wears this one the most.  Even on days when he gets it super dirty, it washes up easily without even using prewash/stain remover.  I am happy with this one considering the price we paid.<br>_________________________________<br><br>PURCHASE #3 of 3 CHARCOAL...<br>RUNS A BIT BIG!<br><br>This review is for the CHARCOAL colored shirt.  The shirt is a nice dark color,  which helps keep it clean.  I was concerned about the shirt being too hot.  As mentioned in my other shirt reviews, my son works at a hardware store in the Garden Center and is outside a lot.  The shirt is lightweight and thin, so he hasn’t gotten too warm in it.  Being that the color is dark, the fact that it is thin is not a big issue like it is with the white one.  Much like the white shirt, the material on this one is a bit scratchy.  It’s been washed several times and still has that scratchy feeling.  Also much like the white one, this one tends to run a bit larger than a regular XL shirt.  We have been rotating the 3 shirts during his weekly schedule.  Although they may not be my favorite purchase or even really a great “deal”, I wouldn’t return them.  All 3 shirts, despite their differences, have held up well and are good work shirts.

  This time of year you don't need a sweater in Mississippi yet, but long sleeves are a must. I was looking online for some cost-effective long-sleeve shirts that I could easily wear for business casual and casual. This was perfect. It looks good with slacks or jeans. Looks and feels good.

  The fabric is a little light compared to the ""heavy cotton"" that is often used in such shirts, but it is good.  When they say they will deliver a 4X XL,  they mean business.  I am a big guy and need the big sizes.  I recent years have dreaded plumber butt, but this shirt has THAT covered!

  These are awesome!!!<br><br>First and foremost it is a jersey knit not a polo knit: so it feels like a light weight tee shirt which is awesome in the summer time.  I work a combination of indoors and outdoors so a tee shirt with a collar is a real plus around my office.<br><br>The fit is amazing.  I'm built like a fire plug...  5'11"" and 220 lbs.  I have a 48"" chest, but normally wear a 50-52 coat for my shoulders...  well, the XL is a perfect fit for me.  A large fits me better across the chest  and is more form fitting (it's snug, but not tight) but the XL fits my shoulders and is a lot more comfortable.  In my opinion the sizing is SPOT ON ACCURATE.  From the jerzees website: L = 46, XL = 50.<br><br>Even better than the way it fits in the chest is the sleeves.  They go all the way to my elbows.  A standard polo sleve bunches up and creeps up to my shoulder...  this shirt has a roomy shoulder so it doesn't bunch up and the sleeves go all the way to my elbow (straight armed it stops about 1.5 - 2"" above the crease in my inner elbow).<br><br>Lastly is the length... at 5'11 I can tuck this shirt in into my jeans or slacks and it looks great.  Most polo shirts in an XL are either way too long (hang past my crotch) or way too short (stop at my belt).  This one was designed to be worn tucked in.<br><br>If you are taller than 6 feet, I'd look at the tall sizes... if you're heavier (thicker in the middle) look at the numbered sizes.  A ""secret"" to shirt sizing that many don't know is that an XXL and a 2XL are not the same cut.  In football terms an XXL is for a running back while a 2XL is for a lineman.  If you're stocky in the middle get the numbered size... if you're a big guy with a V-back (narrow waist), then go for the multiple X sizing.<br><br>For washing... The tag says machine wash and machine dry.  Personally: I just toss them in the machine on cold and then dry them on low to about half way (15-20 minutes on low heat) ...  then hang dry them the rest of the way so they don't shrink (they're not supposed to shrink since they're 50% poly but it is still a knit shirt).

  Needed a green shirt for work. I’m 5’0 weighing at 200lBs so I did order a medium being that men clothing run bigger than women. I wore a thin v neck shirt under so it did fit snug like a medium should.

  I bought these as a cheap replacement for my old all cotton shirts by another company altogether. They do seem cheap. Firstly, they have a strong chemical odor not usually associated with cotton/polyester. At least not in my experience. Secondly, they are very thin. The material is light in weight. they may do be5tter after a washing (I got them not 30 minutes ago), and we will have to see. the one thing that I am afraid of is the material may be actually more polyester than cotton. It is ""supposed"" to be 50/50. But, I really don't think so. I am relying on my experience in clothing, and my first visual impression to make that statement. I am not expecting much. Will update in a few months. If they last that long.<br>24 hrs later: washed etc, They did ""fluff"" a miniscule amount. I noticed that when I took them from the washer they were almost dry to the touch which leads me to believe less cotton. More polyester.

  Like that the collar does not get a permanent crease. Armholes are good size for men with muscles. My husband usually complains they are too tight, but he likes these. Length is perfect  for average 5'7"" man. Husband said that the stistitching on the bottom edge is very nice.  Has been washed multiple times, color is still intact.  Material doesnt pick. Shirt is used for work, manual labor, getting dirty etc.... not a desk job. But looks nice too- so it would still be nice for office.  Dry's fairly quickly when he gets wet. Not a bad wrinkle shirt, very good wash and wear, is 50/50 poly/cotton.  Will be orderung a good deal more of these. Were hesitant at first when it arrived.

  The shirt was never worn &amp; it's already ripping at a seam. We washed it per the washing instructions &amp; the first time it was put on, we noticed the rip. Poor quality and not well made. It fit great, I guess you get what you pay for.

  If you have a dog that sheds, please be forewarned that this shirt will collect every single dog hair in the dryer. Every. Single. One. #polyester It will come out looking like your animal is attached to it somehow. I have to spend ten minutes (not exaggerating) removing dog hair with both a lint brush and a lint sticky roller. The shirt is great and fits great and washes well with no fading and wrinkling, but it is NOT pet hair friendly. Everyone else, knock yourself out, because it is a great shirt.

  Won't be ordering any more of these. Any food that gets on them leaves a stain that never comes out. I've never had shirts stain so easily. If you spill a drink on it, it beads up and rolls off, which is cool. But any kind of sauce, oil, anything with fat will instantly and permanently bond to the shirt.<br><br>On the plus side they fit great and look nice. Fabric is thin and cool. I wear them every day as work shirts. But I can't be replacing them constantly because I get a little dribble of salad dressing on them.

  These are essentially long sleeve t shirts with collars.  The material is extremely thin.  I expected them to be thicker, similar to some Jerzees t shirts I have. However, the fit is excellent on me so I kept them.  Don’t count on them keeping you very warm though.  If it’s ultralight weight you’re looking for , these are perfect. They should breathe well.  I’m 5’11 / 185 lbs with an athletic build and XL fit good.<br><br>Update:  After washing these (with cheer color guard only) the material actually got thicker and softer feeling, and the shirt is quite comfortable.  I’m wearing it right now for the first time.  The cuffs are extremely soft and luxurious feeling, and the shirt is nice and soft to the touch, more-so than expected.  It’s in the low 60’s right now in Chicago and the shirt is perfect (for me).  It’s still a rather thin material for a long sleeve shirt (thus the economical price) but it’s perfect for wearing around the house with shorts or as a layer under a jacket or warm sweater when the temps drop to the low 40’s tonight.  The material has a nice stretchiness to it, but I think it’s in the weave and not the material, which is 50/50 cotton/polyester, no mention of the common 2% Lycra.  It didn’t shrink much, if at all,  in the wash;  they advertise that it’s preshrunk and I’d agree, and the length, both shirt and sleeve, for XL is plentiful for me at 5’11”.  Often the arms shrink and end up a little short on me unless I go up a size, so this is a nice surprise.  Jerzees didn’t skimp on the amount of, albeit thin, material.  This polo is well worth the $10 price on Amazon.

  I found myself struggling most mornings to put an outfit together for work, my solution - create a uniform! These have all the fashion and function of a button down, without requiring you to actually button anything. They are durable and machine washable, which add an extra layer of convenience and they go well with a sport jacket, making them versatile (and inexpensive) additions to your corporate wardrobe.

  Super thin material. See my photo showing how see through this is. Thank God I bought a white T-shirt for underneath. This is for my 13 yo son who has a little weight issue. He needs it for a orchestra concert tomorrow so I’m stuck with it and I hope the T-shirt is a good barrier. So if you’re not perfectly ripped and don’t want people to see your moobs or belly, don’t buy this shirt!

  This is my second shirt from this style. I got a blue one and liked it a lot, now have a color choice. Originally wanted long sleeve protection when doing outdoor community outreach projects for a club. For that purpose it is excellent. It turns out to be stylish enough to wear to casual nice activities like a meal with family. I usually end up wearing my lunch. Yesterday a blob of dressing from a sandwich wiped right off and the shirt came through the wash with no spot. Good stain protection and no wrinkles from the dryer. Fit is as expected (just right for my XXL torso) and finish quality is good. Very happy with this shirt!

  You maybe looking at this shirt because you want to wear it for work or for everyday. It will totally work for both but I needed a halloween costume. So I purchased it 3 sizes too big and went a Felicia from the movie Friday.

  The color and size were as expected, but the shirt is pretty thin.  It wrinkles pretty easily.  It was good for summer.  The issue I usually have with polos are:<br>1. The collar<br>2. The sleeves<br>3. The length<br><br>The collar on this one was ok.  Over time though, because it is thin, I expect it will roll up at the ends, which is annoying<br>The sleeves on this are odd, which may be because of the thinness.  Where the band on the end of the sleeve is sewn to the sleeve it is very pronounced.  It makes it just kind of look odd.<br>Time will tell on the length.  What I see usually happens is that the back of the shirt will shrink up, and the front won't... which makes it wearable only if you tuck it in.  Otherwise it gets a boxy look.  I expect this one will do that, but so far it's ok.<br><br>Overall was hoping for a solid cheap polo, and was planning to buy several more. Glad I waited and only got one to try out, because my search continues.

  Strange feel for a cotton/poly mix. The shirt is very scratchy to the point of irritation, especially around the collar. The sleeves are ultra-tight at the wrists. And the general shape is American -- i.e., small in the chest, big in the belly... I originally thought all the color variations were a great feature. But I would not buy this shirt again after purchasing just one. ""You get what you pay for"" definitely holds true on this one...

  I bought this for myself. I'm a 145 lb woman standing 5' 8"". I wanted long sleeves and couldn't find this shirt in the women's dept. I was amazed at how good the top fit in xl. The sleeves are nice and long and the material is a cotton blend, which makes it lightweight. The length of the body is long, so if you're long waisted this will fit. It's almost too long for me as it comes down to the tops of my thighs. Great product, I'd definitely purchase this again.

  I was looking for a decent golf shirt at a good price.  The price ($9) seemed to be a tremendous bargain especially given the very positive reviews.  So, I ordered one to try.  Sizing was not an issue. The problem is the material is so flimsy it's almost transparent.  In part may have been because I ordered white.  I tried to return it through Amazon but got a message that it wasn't allowed.  So, I donated the shirt to a charity.  Darker colors may be better choice.  I think some may like this shirt but it wasn't what I expected.

  2/22/20: My apologies to Jerzees... I got my shirts mixed up and said some things in my original review that weren't true.  What follows is the updated, accurate assessment of their shirt.  I also upped the rating to 4 stars as I feel is appropriate.<br><br>I ordered the Kelly green polo, but their color palatte is off.  It is too bright/fluorescent to be considered a true Kelly green, so I'm disappointed about that.<br><br>But that's about all I'm disappointed with.  I have to say that the shirt is constructed/stitched in a quality manner, and size-wise it fits as expected, and it's not like the shirt looks disgustingly horrible or anything (despite the off color).  For under $10, it's really not all that bad of a shirt (I've paid a lot more for a lot worse in the past), and it represents a great value in men's clothing.

  Quality made but I feel it was a touch smallish. No problem I always order a size larger for Ts and Polos as I like a longer tail to tuck in. These aren't 100% cotton but are very comfortable anyway once washed. Having a little bit of synthetic fiber helps keep their shape and seems to make them last longer. Coupled with its low price I feel this is a bargain.<br>All in all very happy.

  The shirt came quickly and it looks and feels very nice for the price.  I generally wear size XL but this particular shirt in XL was much too large so I exchanged it for a size L.  The cotton-polyester blend is definitely superior to 100% cotton.  This shirt can be used as uniform attire or even business casual attire if you throw on some slacks.  I wish these came in wider array of colors, other than that, I'm very happy with this purchase.

  It is not a bad product it just has some flaws.  The sizing of this shirt runs a bit large - except in the sleeve diameter below the elbow.  When you looked at this did you note the banded cuffs?  These are fairly small and the diameter of the sleeves below the elbow is fairly small as well.  I live in the South where it rarely gets very cold.  It is important to be able to adjust warmth as the day progresses by shedding layers and \or rolling up sleeves.  That is the major problem with this shirt.  It is difficult to push the sleeves up and expose forearms.  I did grab the cuff and the lower sleeve and pull until it stretched out a bit.  I was then able to push them up some but not as far of as comfortably as I would like.

  I ordered these for my son because he has to wear a uniform to school. They are very well made and comfortable. I ordered a size bigger than my son usually wears because uniform shirts normally run small and my son is the size of a grown man. They are a little too big but they are wearable. The way my son is growing that might not be such a bad thing. These shirts are true to size so don't order a size up or size down. Unfortunately due to the coronavirus pandemic I changed my mind and ended up having my son not go to school and participate in remote learning so he will never get to wear them to school this year. Hopefully next year he will have to wear the same color as this year and he can use them in the 8th grade. I make him wear it during school hours during remote learning when he is in a class meeting on camera. I am glad that I only ordered two but I got them for a great price. I am a very happy customer and definitely recommend these shirts to everyone.

  I wish it was easier to find a shirt like this for women that didn't cost 3x as much. I usually wear an XL so I ordered a L because it was men's. It fits just a little bigger than I'd like but I figured it might shrink over time. I wear this shirt for work and I needed something that wouldn't stain and would wash and dry well. It also needs to hold up to repeated washings since I wash my work clothes after every shift. I also get coffee, mocha sauce, etc on me at work and so far this shirt is holding up great! Good value for the price.

  I ordered a black large and it was huge. At 50/50, it was not going to shrink so I exchanged it for a medium and the color to gray. The replacement is way too small and the weight of the fabric was far less. I give up. It is just too much trouble buying things on line. Now, I can't leave because of the virus. This one will go in the Goodwill box.

  You absolutely cannot beat the price! This is a ""tee shirt"" weight - not quite as soft as a tee shirt but not rough by any means. The fit is not too baggy but definitely big and square enough to fit a big guy (I am 6 feet and 220 pounds with broad shoulders). Not sure how it would do if you had a big belly but I have a regular sized waist and the shirt fits me fine. Great for wear when a tee shirt is too informal but you don't want to dress up any more.

  I ordered four these shirts, in four different colors. I ordered a large which is normally a bit big on me, but a better fit than a medium. With these shirts the large is a bit small, not small enough to return, but a little smaller than I have come to expect from a Men's Large.<br><br>The shirt is comfortable, but a bit thin. I have only had them for a couple washings, so I do not know how they will hold up long term. As thin as they are I am concerned. Time will tell.<br><br>Overall, for the price they are a great shirt. If they hold up well, I will buy again.

  I needed this for that day, Friday, where we are to wear a polo shirt and jeans. I don't really wear polo shirts so wasn't looking to spend a lot of money on them. I am writing this review in August having bought it the previous December.<br>It's fairly comfy and the fit is right. It fits a little loose but doesn't hang off me, it hangs down just the right length in my opinion. Having run it through the wash many times now I can say it doesnt appear to have faded, and the stitching isn't falling apart either. Honestly, for what you pay for these, I consider that to be pretty good.

  I really don't like to write reviews that are not positive, but I must on this one, in that I feel I can prevent non-positive reactions when you receive yours.  I wanted something inexpensive, but decent looking for my husband, an artist, to wear on a daily basis.  This is about the most unattractive shirt in everyway that I can think of.  It is flimsy, it's colors are dull, it looks like they took to pieces cut out the outline and sewed them together...that's not what they did, but the shirt sure looks like it.  I was so offended, that I went through the entire return process even though they were quite inexpensive.  At $9.00 it was not worth it!

  These polo shirts fit very nicely.  I have broad shoulders and a moderately muscled chest.  I find often that shirts that fit my chest and shoulders are then too big around the waist and too long.  These Jerzees polos are the exception at they fit me well in all areas and add to a slimming appearance.  I bought these as something akin to a uniform for my massage business work.  The chest and shoulder fit is trim enough to accentuate my torso shape and roomy enough to accommodate my reaching and lifting of clients during my work.  I will order more, too, as I like these as everyday wear better than just T-shirts.

  Fits as expected, and a great quality garment at this price point. I work in industrial sales, I love these shirts because I don't feel guilty when I get grease on them or catch the corner of a machine and put a hole in it.<br><br>The stain guard is a double edged sword. They don't stain easy, this is true, even after several washed the liquids just bead up and roll off without penetrating the fabric, this is also the downside for me. The shirts don't adsorb sweat AT ALL. The sweat rather stays on your skin, and leaves a icky feeling as it beads and rolls off your back. I've noticed after 20 or so washings it's better, but still not super comfortable in a hot humid environments. I'm forced to wear a undershirt under these, more layers, hotter, but helps absorb sweat.

  Needed a shirt for work that was black , polo and comfortable. Normally, when I order shirts they are made of some sort of sweaty  blend of fabric which makes it horrible to wear and hot. Not this bad boy! This is cotton, comfortable, professional but I'm not suffering the dreaded itchy fabric blues.  A shirt that says, I am a professional but I'm not itchy.

  I'm a five foot one female and weigh 160 lbs, carrying most of my weight in my midsection.  I had to return the women's size large polo shirts in lieu of the men's medium. They fit perfect.  And I love the California blue because it is more teal then it is turquoise.  They wash and wear very well.  I took them out of the dryer after the cool down cycle and there were very few wrinkles.  Not even enough to iron.  They don't seem to have shrunk, either, since they are 50% polyester and 50% cotton.

  I've been searching for the right shirt for our adult team mentors for over a year.. and from the feedback, I thought I'd try this one. This shirt is excellent.  The fabric is super soft for wearing and yet the shape and fabric are stable.  No wrinkles after 14 hours of wear, looks as fresh and new as when it came.  Washes up ""like new"".  (I washed one of the 8 we purchased, and could not tell which one was washed compared to the others, it retained the same fit and same quality as the not-yet-washed.)<br>For those who want to know: it is also the right fabric for an embroidered logo. (Many shirts' weave is too loose or too tight, distorting the logo after it's stitched on; or after washing the shirt the logo is too loose on the tighter, shrunk fabric.)  The aspect was my biggest concern when I purchased them: would this shirt work great for a stitched logo?  We took it to our embroiderer and the resultant logo is crisp, clean, not distorted. In a word: perfect.  Even after washing multiple times.  The background fabric is major component to achieving a beautiful logo.  This shirt exceeded my expectations.<br>For ""fit"" I compared the medium to the large, and the difference is 1"" extra inch on either shoulder, and 1-1/2"" longer.  The shirt is not tapered and fits the adult body that is not quite as slim as he/she used to be perfectly.  (If you are wavering in sizes between M and L, if the person is a skinny, pick the M, it will fit without the bulk of extra fabric around the waist.)  I'll be back for more shorts as our team expands. Very happy!

  I feel reviews are super important to help other online shoppers. With that being said, I read reviews of this shirt and it was highly rated so I decided to purchase two in white. However, when my order arrived, I was extremely disappointed with the material quality. These shirts are super thin and you can see through them! My son tried one on and you could see the color of his nipples through them. Very disappointed since I have other Jerzees shirts and have been happy with them.

  This is a fine shirt. It looks good, it fits well, it seems to hold up to repeated washings. The navy color is very close to what's pictured, and the fabric feels better than what you expect from a poly blend. However, there is a very strong chemical smell that has persisted through multiple washings. Maybe it's a fire retardant coating or something to do with the spot shield marketing. Whatever it is, the smell lingers on other clothes stacked on or near the shirts. That alone will keep me from buying another copy of this shirt.

  I'm 5'8"" and got the medium. Fit is good overall but the sleeves are too tight. Not so tight as to ruin the shirt but a little annoying. So the medium is a bit small on me overall, but I'm sure the large would be too large. As with most shirts. Fabric is a tiny bit on thin side but not enough to be a problem. I like the Comfortably Collared polo fabric better, but as of this date, those are available in very few colors.

  The quality is pretty good for what you’re spending. I bought a couple of these for a job uniform. They wash and wear well. I thought it may shrink after first wash, but not at all.<br><br>What I like most is they don’t really get dirty or wet. Literally spilled some of my lunch onnthe shirt when someone accidentally bumped me, and it didn’t leave a stain on it when I cleaned myself off. Also, I got caught up working outside when it started pouring rain and the shirt didn’t really even get soaked and barely wet. Rain drops beaded up onnthe shirt. When I got out of the rain, I pulled the shirt off and shook it; and the beaded up rain drops just fell/flew off..<br><br>Will definitely buy a few more soon, so I won’t  have to wear any of my ‘nicer’ polos to work anymore.

  I bought this one for my husband. The price was very cheap so we were hesitating about the quality, but we decided to try with a black one, he loved it so much because is like wearing a t-shirt but with a bit more style, we are leaving in Texas, the fabric is awesome for being comfortable in a hot weather. So after the black one, we bought a charcoal one, we confirmed it was following the same standards of the black one, then we decided to buy more colors and an extra black!!! Now he is plenty of these polos, he can wear them for going to office and for the weekends, he can wear them with jeans, with dockers or more formal pants and those fit with everything!!

  I've bought a half-dozen of these shirts in various colors and LOVE them. Very comfortable, and perfect for winter in Arizona (daytime highs in 50s and 60s).  I'm 6'5"", and take a 36"" sleeve in dress shirts, and these shirts (XL size) are long enough in both the body and sleeves without needing Tall sizes.  No shrinkage to speak of after multiple washings. Two thumbs up!

  My teen son, who is on the autism spectrum, is extremely picky about fabrics, so I don't often buy clothing online for him. However, he had to have slightly dressier shirts than his usual screen print t-shirts for a trip with his school, and so I ordered him a few polo shirts from Amazon. This particular shirt was so soft, so comfortable, that he texted me the first day he wore it in Europe to thank me for buying ""the green collared shirt."" Thank you, Jerzees!

  Some of the reviews with pictures show tears in the fabric and claim it was very cheap but my experience has not been as such. My job requires us to wear polos to work and cover up tattoos so these longsleeve polos have been fantastic. I own the black navy and gray ones and they're comfortable despite being 50% polyester, which mind you is definitely not the most comfortable material but this feels fine. I only ever use these for work, but if you want to go out and look a little better than just a casual T-shirt these also look fantastic.<br><br>I've bought polos where the wrist tends to be too loose but this one hugs around it very nicely and gives it a nice fit. So far so good, definitely ordering more

  I’m not very impressed with this shirt, but you get what you pay for. The quality is meh- okay as a back up when my better shirts are in the wash. Thin enough that you can see my tattoos thru the sleeves, so maybe use that in making a decision.

  This is a very nice looking white polo shirt. The thickness is perfect! It is comfortable and thick enough so it is not see-through. The stitching is well done and this shirt has held up nicely in the wash. The collar does not curl  in the wash which is really nice. It seems to be stain resistant. The fit is true to size. I purchased it for someone who is 6 ft 5 and it fits him perfectly. This is a high-quality shirt.

  I paid about $8.50 for this polo shirt from Amazon.  It is 50% cotton / 50% polyester.  Overall,  the shirt fits as expected and is a great value for the price.<br><br>Don't pretend you didn't know what you were getting.  Of course 100% cotton is more breathable.  It also shrinks.  The 50/50 blend does not and the shirt feels just fine.

  I work in warehouse where the men are expected to wear collared shirts. It is almost summer and it is getting very hot. I wanted to get some polo shirts that were more of a t-shirt fabric. This polo is very thin and semi see through but its exactly what I needed for its intended purpose. I didn't want to purchase your traditional polo that is usually thicker. This polo is definitely light and still looks great. I don't have to wear an under shirt because since it is light and more of a t-shirt material it does not irritate my skin or make me itch. I recommend this polo if you want to still look semi business casual. I washed them with my other work clothing and dried them on a delicate setting(low heat). It didn't shrink that much but I'm not sure how much it will shrink if you dry on a different dryer setting.

  Good-looking long sleeve white polo shirt. I bought this for someone who is hard to size. He is 6 ft 5 in and lifts weights. This fit well in the chest and in the waist. Usually if it fits the chest then the waist is big but this was just right. It is been washed and it has held its shape nicely and remains nice and white. The quality on the shirt is terrific and the thickness of the material is nice.

  I ordered 5 of these for the summer. I've had them for about 3 months. I wear each one about once a week. They're already showing significant wear and pills everywhere. You do have to iron them. This is very disappointing, especially because I hang dry them. Next summer I'll definitely spend more money to buy a higher quality material that will last more than 1 season.

  This type of shirt is a better work shirt than the full button up shirt because it doesn't bind which allows better movement. I doesn't shrink around the neck causing an uncomfortable restriction around the neck. The full coverage prevents sunburn,especially on the back of the neck.

  This shirt is made from thin material so it's fine for cool weather. Thicker fabric is sometimes is often too hot for fall/spring.  fits great. I also splashed some food on it and it came off without being absorbed. Have not washed it yet, so this feature may change over time. The price is low, so my expectations are modest.

  I don't quite know why I bought these shirts in a 50% cotton blend when what I needed was a 100% synthetic, moisture wicking fabric. And sure enough, it goes to show, cotton drags down a fabric's performance in summertime heat and humidity, but synthetics save the day. With full-on synthetic shirts, sweat doesn't show, and it's drawn away to the outside where it can evaporate. Almost any stains will disappear after a few washings. And they dont fade; they last years and years even with daily use. These shirts approximate all that but they are hotter on, they will stain, they do show sweat, and they are heavier and more stifling than I am used to. And the whole evaporative cooling effect that makes me go ""Aaaah!"" when the slightest breeze comes along just isn't there. These are more for light indoor work with only occasional outdoor exposure.

  This is a good, standard polo shirt. It's good quality, not too heavy, great for summer. The price is good for what you get. I like my casual shirts on the loose side, and this one does not run large at all.<br>I would order Jerzees again, if I needed another polo shirt.

  I have several of these shirts, and they’re all great. Really good “uniform” shirts. Vibrant colors. Good, comfortable fit. Stain and spot resistance. But, the kicker with this particular shirt is....<br>I didn’t receive THIS shirt. What I got was the long sleeve version, in a package labeled ‘short sleeve’. It’s a good shirt, and I was considering getting a long sleeve or two anyway. I even double checked my order just to be sure I didn’t select the incorrect item. Nope... just the wrong shirt in the right package. Things happen. Happy accident!

  My husband is an usher for church and for dress down Sundays they required them to find a long sleeve, 3 button down, collared shirt.  Surprisingly, it was a lot harder to find and expensive!  This product was a small fraction of what other companies wanted and honestly is perfectly fine.  It is durable enough to wear once a month when he serves and doesn't look ""cheap"".  It is slightly bigger than what he expected but not terribly big.  We would recommend the shirt to anyone who is need of these specifics.

  Great value for this shirt!  I am ordering more in different colors. Made well. Fabric is lightweight but that is exactly what I wanted for the warm Nevada weather.  The sizing is as stated, the size I got is a 4X-Large and it is just like most other 4X-L from AMERICAN companies such as Hanes, Duluth Trading Post, etc.  I always wash my clothes in cold water and dry on low heat so I do not expect any shrinkage.

  Shirt is a great bargain for the price. It is not misrepresented in any way. It is a thin shirt with a polo style collar that is very comfortable to wear.

  I'm a busty 5'8"" female with really large arms. I have a very difficult time finding shirts that fit my chest and arms without being like a moo-moo in my stomach area.

They go to my elbow and don't slide up when I move my arms. Absolutely love these shirts and bought one in almost every color!

  I was looking for inexpensive cotton polo shirts to wear in the winter, primarily under other layers. The shirt would not need to be super fancy, only comfortable. This shirt, though very plain, is exactly what I was looking for. It is also tagless which adds to the comfort level. This shirt has a nice long tail, so it stays tucked in. I would not recommend this shirt for wearing untucked.

  My husband needed 3 white polos. I ordered these because I was pleased with the stainguard. Once received they felt a little thin. I ordered 3 more of a different brand and tried to return these.

  Great shirt for an even better price. They really are ""spot resistant"" and even water doesn't stain them (it collects as little droplets on the shirt, looks pretty cool and reduces dampness after rain/spills/etc.). Colors are vibrant, fit is perfect for tucking in or leaving untucked. I bought 4 of them for use at work, doing a relatively physical job, and they've held up great and maintained their appearance. They're breathable too, which is an added bonus. Highly recommended!

  I ordered these for my husband for work. He works in a factory and he really likes them. They are very comfortable, don't wrinkle easily and don't show sweat. Our only complaint is that they collect lint like crazy, so if that matters to you buy a lint roller to go with them!

  The shirt is good quality with a great color that I have been complimented on already in its first use today. The only issue is i noticed that if I wash these shirts and purely hang dry as I normally do the shirts run a little bigger than normal for a Large but its not to the point where its Extra Large size. So my tip is to wash and use a dryer once then hand dry from that point on.

  This could be my mistake, or my body.  The shirt fit reasonably well except for that fact that it was very tight through the chest area.  I may try a medium versus the small size I purchased, but I suspect that would be a little too big all around.  The shirt appears to be good quality.

  I like the shirt, and it is mostly comfortable, but I don't have broad enough shoulders for the amount of space that they have for the top of the sleeves. This causes the sleeves to sag down until the end of the sleeves are at my elbows.  I have to occasionally pull up the sleeves so they are at the right height.

  These shirts are the equivalent of t-shirts with a collar.  Their cost and material is comparable.  Why wear a classless t-shirts when a nice polo leaves a better first impression.

  Very thin fabric. But it was inexpensive and came in the purple color that is the uniform color for the high school where my husband works as a teacher. Even though he can wear what he wants most days because he is a teacher, not a student, he likes to wear the school uniform fairly often (even when it is not a ""spirit day"") as a positive role model for the kids who often seem to try to get away with wearing something other then the required uniform.

  The quality of this shirt supersedes the price by far!  I have a larger chest and back for my frame so I usually need a Large.  However, the sleeves on a large are usually a bit long or loose.  The medium fits a little snug, but not enough to make me look like I've got something to prove.

  While this isn't the perfect shirt, it's great for a wash and toss on. I bought it for my husband and after several washed I've noticed no fading, pilling, or shrinking. It doesn't wrinkle, and he likes to wear it to work as a ""beat it up"" shirt. The collar is my only complaint. It's soft and will curl if you don't watch it so if that's not an issue for you this is a good purchase. You can't beat the price!

  I bought 2 of these for my husband who is a 2x Large. He's very picky about how a shirt feels on his skin and he's hard on shirts. These fit the bill in both areas! They are very sturdy but still soft enough to make him happy. The only issue was the seam on the cuffs of the sleeves scratching him, which he remedied by folding them up to the seems. I couldn't even tell he did it. They fit him perfectly. I ordered the black and purple. The black is a nice dark black and the purple is a bright, vibrant purple. They match several shorts and pants of his, giving him options of either a playful casual look or something more dressy. I'll probably buy a couple more!

  The fit is good, not tight, not too long. I am 5’8”, 195lbs. Not skinny, but not huge. I ordered a large. The sleeves are a little long they come the full length of my upper arm and they should stop mid bicep or a little longer. The material is thin, so a decent warm weather shirt. Also it is a 50/50 blend so it shouldn’t shrink. So for $9 or so,  not a bad buy and I can get the sleeves tailored.

  First, there is a problem with the review process.  There is the question: ""How does this product fit?"".  Only one answer is accepted, so I'll just say it here.

  I bought this polo because I had a Jersey polo for several years that fits great but was wearing out. I'm glad to say that their sizing template is still very close to what it was years ago.<br><br>Buying clothes as a tall slender person sucks, most clothes are made for short and/or fat people. If you need a longer length shirt or sleeve you have to go up a size, which almost always means they add several inches to the waist and then you end up with a puffy shirt that drapes and flaps off you.This is the only brand of polo what I've found that fits good and has a long length and a tight fit.<br><br>The fabric is pretty good, but could be a bit softer. Overall I feel very comfortable wearing this polo.

The bottom cut and design works well if you need to do security work and you have CCW license / permit. Holds up well through machine washings and bounces back. I will be ordering more in the future!

  Just what I wanted.  The fabric is very lightweight, but entirely opaque, so it is a great warm weather shirt.

  Imagine your favorite T-shirt, then turn it into a polo by giving it ribbed short sleeve cuffs and a 3 button ribbed collar. That is what these feel like. I have several of them now in various colors. Great shirts! Very happy even after at least a dozen washes. Colors stay bright after repeated washings.

  You can't beat the price and the overall fit and appearance.

  I purchased eighteen of these on a leap of faith and cannot be more pleased. These are about a third of the cost of the brands I have been using, and while my previous brands are marginally better, for the price these are a five star value in my opinion.<br><br>These are fairly thin - about the same weight as a medium weight T-shirt - but are nicely made with excellent stitching and a fit that is as good as the more expensive polo shirts that they are replacing. If there is a single complaint, the collars do not lay as nicely as my premium shirts, but that is minor considering the price.<br><br>I test fit them when I first received them, and after I was satisfied that I would not be returning them I machine washed them on cold/cold and there was no shrinkage that I could discern. More importantly, there was no fading. I will say that when I dried them the lint trap did fill quickly, so on first wash there are a lot of loose fibers.<br><br>Bottom line: these are decent quality and especially for the price. They are ALMOST as well made and fitting sas premium brand polo shirts, and if you are on a budget are a definite bargain.

  It’s great and comfy. Got for my son for school and he’s a lil bigger than most kids at ten years old. It’s nice to be able to just go to these people and get something that will not only fit my child but they don’t fade or shrink. And there’s a lil play room not all snug on him. I’m very satisfied with the quality.

  I love these Jerzees because they fit great and they look even better.

  Great price, great feel!  It's a roomy 50/50 (witch I like a lot - it means it will wear well and get softer with time/washes) solid black plain polo shirt, not a big fan of the ribbed/pipping on the end of the sleeves. It's 50 poly and 50 cotton combo means it can last 12 years if cared for and worn three times a month. But otherwise this is a shirt that will get softer with time and has a very rich and dark black (my color) shade - I like it... a lot. If it fades or shrinks to much I'll be back and give an update.

  Like the 50/50 blend and the XLarge worked great for me--6""1-195. Not sure how it will come out of the wash but for $12 if I get 4-5 good wears out of it then it is worth it. I liked it better than some Perry Ellis long sleeves I bought.

  The cuffs were too small and I had to cut them off. You're better off buying the nicer $30 polo work shirts. I am very happy with the higher priced purchase. The material isn't very breathable. It was overall a waste of money but did its job until the higher quality shirt came.

  My husband like his shirts. I got him the 3xl as I was not sure how much it would shrink. It did shrink a little, but he still liked the Shirt. I would say that if you are unsure what size to get, just buy 1 shirt at the size you normally wear, wash &amp; dry it to see if it still fit you the right way. That way you are only out about $10.00's verses $100.00's.

  I purchased this shirt in deep purple for my work uniform. It fit true to size, but a little long, which I don't mind. It's not a heavy cotton which is nice for the summer months. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the sleeves are really long. I think it's a unisex shirt (if I'm wrong and it's a men's shirt then the sleeve length is appropriate) which is why I got it. However when I tried it on and subsequently wear it, I have to roll the sleeves up a little . They reach my elbows.

  These shirts are a really great value.  The sizing is pretty accurate, but the shirts are definitely on the long side and are meant to be worn tucked in.  When tucked in, I think they look pretty good.<br><br>The material feels a bit odd initially and it doesn't absorb sweat at all, so don't expect these to feel or behave the way cotton shirts do.  Also, the workmanship on the sleeves and collar are somewhat cheaply done, but it is to be expected on shirts at this price.

  I bought several of these for my grandson for school. These shirts have a velvety feel to them and are not cheaply made! I am impressed. They are easy-care and fit with enough room to be comfortable (he has a husky build). The sleeves come down past his wrist just enough to cover them unlike some ""long-sleeved"" polos. They are, in my opinion, bright white and look very nice on him. I had searched the internet for other long-sleeve, white polos and did some math and these came out as the best buy for volume. I think it was an excellent buy. The packaging was secure, delivery fast, and price was great for budget-minded purchasing.

THERE'S NOT AN ELEMENT OF SURPRISE BUT ALSO NO ELEMENT OF SHOCK - THE GIFT NEVER TURNS OUT BADLY THIS WAY AND THERE ARE USUALLY EVIEWS FROM OTHER CUSTOMERS THAT ONE CAN LOOK THROUGH TO AID IN MAKING A FINAL DECISION.

  Not only did this Jersey fit well, it looks nice. Expect to get compliments when you wear it. I'm 5'11"", 180#, a size somewhere between Medium and Large. I usually find, Large fits loose and feels a bit too relaxed, Medium is sometimes a bit tight, and the long sleeves aren't that long. However, this Jersey still fits good, even after a few washes.<br>The Collar has a good firmness and set to it, which I believe gives it its neat appearance. The sleeves have good length, with firm fitting cuffs, maybe slightly smaller but not tight on my arms, which makes it perfect as a base, under shirt. Weather is getting cooler.<br>The body length is long and fits snugly, well below my waist. Not too bulky, that it can be tucked in and stays in.<br>I believe I'll be getting a few more, perhaps with a pocket.

  Buying Clothing on-line, is like a Box of Chocolates. You Never know what your going to get. As for this product, the material is a little thin. And like most Men's Shirts, the Sleeves are Too Long. I mean, why do they always go like 2 inches past your hands? There must be a lot of Really Long Armed people out there...

  The shirt is cut well, and the color is good; it isn't a faded black, but rather a deep black. But I had to return the shirt because the medium fit more like a small. I've ordered a large to replace it, and I might have to make it an XL if the large is cut small.

  As a cotton blend the fabric should wear well and not shrink or lose shape like the 100% cotton shirts. However, this trade off makes the shirt not so soft or comfortable. Fabric while lighter weight than all cotton should wear well as blends normally do. Stitching is fine no overt defects. Overall I'm happy.

  I work in a restaurant and I wear a shirt and tie everyday. My staff jokes that I am putting my drycleaners kid through college because I am always dripping on my shirts. I decided to purchase several of these shirts in an effort to lower my dry cleaning bill. Sure enough, I spilled on it my first time wearing it (bacon grease most likely). I didn't notice it until I put the shirt on after its next washing. Sure enough, there is a stain on it. So I threw the shirt away because the whole point was to not have stained shirts. I haven't stained any of the others yet but this first one made me realized that the spot treatment they have isn't very valuable. The other option is to be more careful and not spill as much food on my clothes as I do but we don't hold much hope for that. Luckily my drycleaners kid is a junior this year so I have plenty of time to find the right shirt.

  I bought eight different colors of the Jerzees polo shirts in size large for under $7.00 each and free shipping.  That's an amazing value for shirts that look good and fit well, and have beautiful colors.  I found the black, J navy, maroon and forest green colors to be especially striking and true.  It's often hard to find such good colors in less expensive shirts.  For example, deep purple is often passed off by manufacturers as black, but the Jerzees black is a very true black.  In general, these shirts are somewhat thin, so would be ideal in warmer weather.<br><br>The Amazon online prices vary widely by color, currently between $6 and $19, with most having free shipping.  The differences in price may be seasonal or based on availability of each color.  Some I paid less than $7 for in February are now $18.99, including black and maroon.  However, even the higher prices aren't bad for these shirts.

  I have never written clothing review before, but I will say, they are the absolute best shirts you can buy for the price. True fit, may be a little too baggy before first wash. If the color continues to stay, I will buy the rest of them!  I was confused by all the negative reviews, but I took a chance and I got some pretty solid shirts. I have black, purple, and navy. I will probably be ordering the rest of the colors.

  For some reason, I can't find this style locally. My son needed some shirts dressier than a T-shirt, but didn't want button-ups or d-bag designs printed on them. These look very nice and the price is great! The fabric is soft, washes well and is comfortable. It shrank a very small amount with the first time in the dryer, but all shirts with cotton will do that. It even packs well without wrinkling too much. The fabric isn't super-thick. I'd say just right.  Bargain! I'll be buying more.

  For the price, yes this gets 5 stars. It's a good basic polo shirt. Comfortable, well sized, and the color matched the picture (I got dark red/maroon). I am 5'7"" with a 34 inch waist and the fit is great. Not baggy, not too tight. Many other brands have a lot of extra material in the mid-section. This looks more professional and fit just right so if you have a big belly it may be tighter on you. Minimal shrinking after laundering. There are better brands out there but you'll pay much more. For this price, I'm getting a few more.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  After decades of dealing with RL shirts that don't last and cost 10x more (not an exaggeration), I find these to be a better fit and value.<br>I started buying these in long sleeve and got one in short sleeve by accident when I changed to sandstone and the picture showed long sleeve white. Being a prime order, I figured if it wasn't right when it arrived, I would ship it back. Well, color was nice, but it came as short sleeve. A happy accident because I would never have started ordering these if I hadn't discovered how much better these were than my Polos.<br>I order mediums. The order choices show s,m,l, and on and on. Then, they say adult s, adult m, adult l, etc. since they don't say child s,m.... I took a chance on the lower prices that came with the exclusion of the word adult. I'll have to assume adult label must be a euphemism for b&amp;t or something else associated with extra roomy because I'm not child size.<br>I'm currently a 44-36. The waste is loose enough to hide less than flat abs. The shoulders fit without hanging over and don't look sloppy yet still have a lot of room in the chest and body. Length was great for low cut jeans, but too much if not tucked in. Much more suited to being tucked in to deal with below waste jeans issues. I actually found myself returning for a small which is really strange sizing.<br>I gave very little thought to the claim of spot protection until I watched salsa disappear with just a wet sponge.<br>So far they are holding up through washes but I caution anyone who does not thoroghly understand how laundry machines work. You cannot use high heat and the toughest cycle for every type of garment. Unless you are wearing these on a construction job and letting it sit for a week before washing, you should use gentle wash cycles and low heat drying with finish guard sensor dryers. If you don't have access to proper dryers or time to watch over timed laundromat machines, remove while slightly damp and use hangers for final drying. Everything will last longer with more care, regardless.

  I have to wear this kind of shirt to work.  I ordered five brands of shirts just to see which one was the most durable.  This shirt, although it is not the most expensive one, is the most durable.  I paid way more for shirts that now have holes in them.  For that reason I ordered more and will be sticking with this one in the future. If you need a shirt that doesn't fall apart for a great price, I highly recommend this.

  Pros: Doesn't lose shape or shorten in the dryer. The collar retains shape. I normally wear large (5""10', 210 pounds) and it fits me well without being tight. Long enough to stay tucked in.<br>Cons: The fabric feels like a T-shirt and not the soft kind. It's not uncomfortable but a little scratchy.<br>Conclusion: It's good for the price. I just wish it was softer.

  Bought this shirt in a size large for my husband. He normally wears a size large but this shirt was a little snug. It was a good price, so I can't complain too much. Since it was such a good price, I went ahead and bought it in an extra-large for him. The extra-large fit a lot better. It seemed to fit him like most mens size large normally fit. It's a decent quality shirt for the price, I would just suggest order the next size up, unless you like the shirt to fit a little more ""fitted"".

  This shirt is a rather nice shirt, fits well and the spotshield does what it says it does but maybe its a little too good. It is so good it'll repeal your own sweat and by that I mean the shirt doesn't wick away moisture as one would hope it would.<br>My recommendations are not to wear it in the summer and not to wear it while doing strenuous physical activities.

  My husband works in the food business as a manager, and is required to wear dress/ casual shirts. This shirt we bought because it has stain guard. Does NOT WORK, it seems,  after the second wash. It does not seem to have stain guard on it after that.<br>The shirt itself is a good shirt. It fits well, it feels good and it keeps it shape after many times of being in the wash, BUT... The stain guard does NOT WORK. Unfortunately, for us, it is back to the drawing board.

  Nice polos, thin but not to thin, I'd say this is more for someone who wants something breathable, maybe for something active, I didn't know the difference between pique and jersey but now that I know I'd prefer pique over this, this feels like it won't last, don't get white because it's see through, and this isn't 100% cotton so be aware that's why it might feel lighter and thinner

"

  This shirt is disappointing, even for the $14 price. The fabric is essentially the same as T-shirt fabric. Construction is about the same as T-shirt construction plus a collar. There are no side vents at the waist or flat stitching in the interior like you get on almost all other polo shirts. Lee-brand polo shirts, also sold here on Amazon, have noticeably better fabric and construction for about the same price.

  Okay so I'm a girl &amp; I work at Walmart so I needed this shirt. So the shirt it's self is awesome. Very light weight and roomy. My bust is 36"" &amp; I got a medium and it fits perfectly on my body &amp; around my boob area. The shirt is kinda thin (I like that about it tho cuz it's very light on your shoulders and doesn't cling to your body) vs like the actual premium 100% cotton polos but for the price and the purpose of wearing it to work it's great! I will most definitely be buying another one in white. ☺️

  The shirts took two weeks to get here and while I got a refund, the shirts are of a very very low quality. They are thin and you can see through them. I have a feeling you would be able to see your undershirt through them because of the low fiber content of these shirts. Plus the seller took over two weeks to ship them to me. Its a good thing I got a refund, because they would've been on the next return shipment back to the vendor anyway. They also are not very long either. FAIL!

"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  A basic style loose fitting classic cut polo shirt comprised of 50 percent polyester, 50 percent cotton fabric, a two button-placket and banded sleeves. The male in residence wears a large polo shirt and the large size fits perfectly. What distinguishes the shirt from regular models is the fabric is treated with spot shield which helps repel water and other substances that may stain. Like all treated fabrics to preserve the life of the treatment laundering requires avoiding chemicals and high heat.<br><br>Specifically mentioned on the fabric care instructions (located on part of the tag-less label printed inside the shirt below the collar) is to not use fabric softener. The fabric care symbols are hard to read which is why I am noting them here--the shirt should be machine washed cold, tumble dry on low, no iron, no bleach and no dry cleaning.<br><br>I measured the large shirt both before and after laundering to gauge shrinkage which was minimal. Chest circumference at point under each arm around is 48 inches before washing, 47 inches after. Length of the body from the top of the shoulder to the hem is 31 inches before laundering, 30 inches after. Sleeve length is 11 inches from top of shoulder to cuff both before and after washing. The circumference of the sleeve opening was 14 inches before laundering and 13 ½ inches after.<br><br>Promptly removing the shirt after drying eliminated all wrinkles. The bottom of the shirt has a 1/2 inch hem which seems sufficient to prevent rolling and the body of the shirt itself is formed like a tube and has no seams. Since seams can rub and chafe eliminating any of them increases comfort.<br><br>There is a loose thread in the bottom hem stitching which I suspect will be a problem if left as is, so I will need to tack that down to ensure it does not unravel. This may be an anomaly with the shirt I received, otherwise construction is good. Economical basic polo shirt treated to be stain resistant in a wide offering of colors and sizes.

"

  Very nice shirt for the price! I was amazed at how comfortable they are and the fit was excellent, even after washing. Material is light weight so they are more geared for warmer weather. The tails are long enough to be worn untucked. I don't particularly like my shirts snug so I ordered up a size and I'm glad that I did. The only down side to this shirt is that there is no shirt pocket. Overall, I'd say that you'd be pressed to find a better shirt at the price these are offered for.
"
3.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This shirt is styled basically like a t-shirt with a collar. It seems like the quality of a shirt you would expect for a uniform in a fast food restaurant or auto repair shop, where you're dealing with messes and spills--not a shirt you would wear to the office or a nice look to wear around casually. It is pretty cool to watch how it sheds liquids and that should extend the life of keeping deep stains out, if laundered properly. I was not a fan of how it looked, and neither was my wife.
"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I brought 3 green uniform with collar on it and it works great for work, but it is too big but its okay. It will shrink later on. I have tried to wash the green t shirt with collar and the colors did not fade off.  Seven bucks for a t shirt is a great deal while walmart and retail stores doesn't carry green t shirt with collars on it. If you weigh 120 pounds, tall, skinny 5'5 small is right for you. Cause when you get Medium t shirt I got has 3 M M M's on it. It would be too big for you and the sleeves are very long to your elbow.  With this price I can't complain.
"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I have had the shirt for three months.  I wanted an inexpensive, casual, lounging shirt.  It fits that need, does not wrinkle (even when left in the dryer for two days).  The 50/50 blend, though, makes it somewhat ""clammy"" if you get active and sweat; not as absorbent as a higher-cotton blend.  I will also note that white buttons on a black shirt do not suit my taste.  Bottom line:  I got what I wanted for a decent price.<br><br>Update (10/2016):  I have raised my rating to 4-stars (from 3).  I got a similar shirt (from a different manufacturer but same price range) with a 60/40 blend.  It is a more comfortable blend for active-wear.  This shirt, however, fits better (everywhere except the collar, which at 18"" feels tight when buttoned).
"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I can tell it is not going to last as long as a more expensive shirt, but I am fine with that.<br><br>I am the kind of person who would rather have a new ""cheap"" shirt every four or five months and then just pitch it, rather than spending more and getting a ""expensive""  shirts that last longer, but then end up having a closet full of old shirts I never wear.<br><br>Cheap, decent quality, logo-less shirts are my thing, and so I give it five stars because that is exactly what I expected, and exactly what I got.<br><br>If you like long lasting, high-quality clothing then I would suggest looking for something else and spending much more; however, if you are like me, then go for this one. Unless, they raise the price over $12 bucks, then go for something else, ha ha.

"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This is a very nice basic polo shirt. It is light-weight and fits true-to-size. I washed it in warm water and dried it on low. It kept its shape and didn't show any appreciable shrinkage. It is wrinkle-free if it is removed from the dryer immediately. This is a good work shirt or project day at home shirt. It's not what I would call fashion wear, but great for at home or a quick run to the store, similar to a t-shirt only stain resistant.
"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This shirt by Jerzees fits exactly as expected for the size. The fit is slightly loose and it's comfortable. The bands around the sleeves are not tight, and the collar isn't scratchy. The seams are sewn evenly and seem strong. The buttons are secure and the buttonholes well stitched. The fabric isn't too thin or thick, but it's also not as soft as we'd like. It's not exactly rough or scratchy but would probably feel comfier if worn over an undershirt. The color is bright and vivid.<br><br>The spot shield works well to repel drips and drops, so it stays looking clean longer.<br><br>Overall, it's a very nice shirt. It could be softer, but it's still comfortable.
"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This shirt lives up to its name! As someone who always pressures anymore and worries about stains prior to work. This shirt has not. It drys and so far no stains have been created from perspiration. It’s also lighter in weight than most shirts of this style which I love about it as well. The color has held up in the wash. Slight shrinkage after the first wash but that’s to be expected. I will purchase again!
"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This does repel liquids and stains to a good extent.  I'm not sure if it is coated with something or if it is from the slightly tight weave. Water, for instance, just bounces off unless it is a very large amount.  This effect has lasted through an initial wash and wear.  The tradeoff, I suppose, is that the fabric is not as soft as some other brands.  It's acceptable though; it isn't itchy or rough.<br><br>It does fit true to size, and the styling is typical.  There are no real surprises in the sizing, cut or color.  It is a very typical polo shirt in a bright royal blue.  It has 2 very basic typical clear pearlized buttons.<br><br>The sizing for the XL (ONLY THE XL) is<br>Chest-  50 inches measured at underarm to underarm and doubled<br>Total length - top of folded down collar to bottom of hem- 33 inches<br>Sleeve width at edge-  7.25 inches
"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  This is a great shirt. Nothing fancy, and is exactly what I was hoping for. It fits nicely, feels nice, and goes well with my darker pair of blue jeans. I've worn it several times, and it hasn't seem to really shrink in the wash.. Another plus.<br><br>If you're in the market for a good quality polo without any frills, this is a safe bet.

  This is a comfortable, basic polo. I like the material, but not as much as the mercurized cotton feel of Ralph Lauren polos.

  I got this for my husband and it was way too big for him.  He is 5’-7.5” with size 44 chest and size 42” waist. And this Large T shirt was big on him.

They made it through the summer and will last the warm days of fall. They will be around next summer for him to wear as well.

  I wasn’t sure if I should or should not order because the reviews were all over the place but I’m glad I took the chance. I ordered Blk/Lrg and it’s great. Husband 5’11approx 175lbs, solid throughout upper back, chest and shoulders. He loves it and I love how it looks on him.  Material wasn’t thin by any means or very thick. It was right in the middle but leaning a tad bit towards the thicker side and for the price it was a steal! It’s  been washed twice in cold, inside out and since it fits perfectly I hang it to dry instead of the dryer. Pretty simple and straightforward. I can’t speak on if it fades much or not since it won’t be going in the dryer and it’s washed in cold.  Not often you find all of those qualities in the same product so we are very satisfied. Ordering another and I’ll review again. ✌🏼

  My son works in a coffee shop and has to wear white shirts for work (crazy, I know).  Out of all the shirts we've tried, these are definitely the best - They stand up to the coffee abuse (seriously, the coffee grounds float in the air so no matter how careful his is, his clothes still get coffee-tinged) and they come very clean when we wash them with some bleach.  Shirts are very soft and comfortable - we highly recommend and plan to buy more!

  This shirt was bought as a part of my son's school uniform for winter months last year. He has grown much since last year, but they still fit. If it is taken out of the dryer right away and hung up it doesn't need ironing.  It fits the desired purpose very well.

  Back in the days of wearing a suit to work, it was always easy to get the correct size for an office shirt.<br>These are given by collar size.  Apparently, get that correct and somehow the chest and back-length are correct too.<br>But for casual wear, these are only given by rough chest size.  For me that would be size M.  However, I am tall and slim and M means it is too short for [back] length.  And the collar size is still totally hit and miss.  A loose collar is no good here in the UK; in the frequently-cooler weather one wants to be able to do up the top button.  I solve the length problem by buying a cheap t-shirt of the same size, cutting off about 4 inches of the bottom and attaching it to the first shirt with hem-tape.<br>Anyway, the M-size of this shirt is just right for me. Long enough in the back – no hem taping here, just about OK collar size (perhaps a tiny bit loose but acceptable).  The shirt also has a good close fit around the wrists and is soft and comfortable to wear.

  I guess you can't expect much more considering the price.  Pay 1/6th the price of a Gap polo shirt, you're gonna get 1/6th the material, and thats kinda what it feels like.  But it you are lookgin for a light summer T-shirt with a collar and don't want to care about accidently ruining an expensive shirt, this is a recommended ""go to""<br>I think these Jerzees will become my ""around-the-house-dad"" shirts

"

  When these arrived (arrived really fast), I was a little concerned that they were a cheap shirt.  Price was cheap, but not necessarily the quality of the shirt itself.  The shirt appears to be a little thin when I removed it from its bag, but the shirt when worn is not really that thin in actuality.  The thin appearance when holding it up is just that in my opinion, an appearance.  What it does do is lets the shirt breath extremely well allowing you to remain cooler than expected on warm days.  While at the same time keeping you warm on cooler days.  Bought two of these, one in green and one in black and am really happy with my purchase.  Curious to see how the color holds up after a few washes.

  Évidemment, à ce prix la qualité n'est pas ''supérieure'' mais J'ADORE ces polos (j'en ai 5 identiques de 5 couleurs différentes parce qu'ils ne sont pas chers)  et j'en porte tous les jours depuis le début de l'été... je les recommande fortement à tous ceux qui aiment ça être vêtus ''décontractés''.  N.B. Pour quelqu'un qui pèse 170 livres, comme moi, il faut un XL

  I ordered a medium but when I tried it on it fit too large.  Shirt hung down well below my waist and the sleeves went down to my elbow.  It’s a nice enough shirt, nice color, looks sharp.  Just fit too large so I returned it.  Prospective buyers might want to consider ordering a size smaller.

  El único inconveniente es que la talla L está muy grande, a mi parecer parece más como talla XL.<br>De lo demás todo bien.
"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  I'm on the edge of small and medium size, so depending of the shirt, polo, t-shirt, I would say that medium is usually my best fit, but sometimes small is ok. So after reading some of the reviews, I was concerned by the medium size being too large for me. I don't like to wear too tight clothes. So I ordered a medium size and for me this polo shirt is just perfect, giving me enough room to be comfortable, without looking too large.<br><br>The fabric is nice, soft and confortable, but not very thick. This for me is perfect, because thick fabric polo shirts are not as confortable.  Also, thick fabrics tend to be warmer, which I don't need for a summer polo.<br><br>Finally the color is perfect and the price just great !
"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"
  These shirts are really comfortable and the darker colours look quite sharp. They're basically high quality, long sleeve T-shirts with a collar. They wash well, with little wrinkling, but don't dry them too long in the dryer. I'm a big guy who is somewhere between XL and 2XL; the 2XL fits me perfectly so if you're not too sure, get the larger size.  I'm buying more.<br><br>Wish they had a dark, charcoal grey.

  We ordered an XL and it was true to size.  The fabric is thin and light.  Sadly;  it says it’s 50/50 Cotton/Poly preshrunk fabric, but it shrunk a couple inches at the bottom only.  It went into a warm dryer, not hot...but it’s it’s preshrunk that shouldn’t matter.  We didn’t need a crop top.  Amazon was gracious and did a return.

  Fit is okay, roomy enough, except for wrists where it is too tight. Can understand why reviewers have complained shirt rips at wrist. Material is rather thin.
