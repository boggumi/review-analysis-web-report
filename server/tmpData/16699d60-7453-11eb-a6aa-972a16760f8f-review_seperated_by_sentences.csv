"the only thing amazing about this shirt is that anyone actually buys the bs that this is 100% cotton‚Äî it‚Äôs absolutely not‚Äî it‚Äôs that horrible wicking fiber junk‚Äî those shirts are wonderful the first time you put them on, hey i used to fall for them too",
very comfortable on the first few outings‚Äî,
but then as they wear the plastic that they are made out of starts to make itself known and no matter how much you wash it if you sweat it in the smell is never coming out,
they also run big‚Äîi bought a large,
and i returned it,
and this was big enough for a guy carrying an extra 80lbs,
i‚Äôm 5‚Äô10‚Äù 180lbs‚Äî i‚Äôd go with a m if you‚Äôre the same size and you don‚Äôt mind these fake man made material shirts,
the best option is high quality cotton shirts ‚Äî light weave,
"there are several out there, banana republic has one‚Äî they also have the bad micro fiber shirts so beware",
it‚Äôs also shameful that they list this as 100% cotton when it‚Äôs clearly not,
"this shirt is made of a wonderfully soft, silky cotton",
but it has a large cloth tag in the neck that can't be removed,
it's very securely glued to the cloth,
and is very stiff and itchy,
"in addition, two shoulder seams that join the collar are sewn with some synthetic material that also itches",
"weirdly, i bought a second shirt from calvin klein at the same time",
different color,
"and it has two neck tags, sewn in, which i was able to remove without damage to the shirt, and the shoulder seams are not annoying",
"i guess their quality control stinks, and they haven't cught up to the rest of the world in placing printed neck tags in their shirts",
i thought everybody was doing that,
"i wouldn't buy these shirts again, and i'll have to be assured that the neck tags are printed in any shirt i buy from now on",
really nice material,
much nicer than expected,
ck logo is small and really not noticeable,
got this to wear on casual date nights and summer evening and have been getting lots of compliments,
"like many ck products, it‚Äôs tight around the arms",
i‚Äôm 6‚Äô 210 with a formerly athletic build so struggle to find good fits,
"but with the exception of the arms, this fits really well",
"got the white one with grey stripes and have paired it with jeans, blue shorts and grey shorts and all have looked good",
i have been wearing calvin klein polo shirts for over 10 years,
i normally purchase the shirts directly from calvin klein,
i love the cut and the fit of their shirts,
for what ever reason the cut of this shirt is different from other calvin polo's i own,
the fit is great,
the weight of the shirt is very nice,
the cut of the shirt is just a little different,
also the collar has a mind of its own,
i was drawn to these polo shirts because they come in a large variety of colors,
i was an avid collector,
i wash them on delicate cycle and line dry them,
the colors are  beautiful and stay vibrant after many many washes,
the interlock fabric is soft and has an elegant appearance,
"sadly, i've noticed that some of the shirts are now showing tiny holes in random places after only several washes",
they quickly get bigger and the stitches start running,
it can't really be fixed,
i am very disappointed,
"i often bought two of the same color, so it will probably happen to those also",
"how can it be, that some are holding up perfectly and others are just terrible",
i wonder if some of these shirts are second rate quality,
found this polo at a calvin klein outlet a year ago,
have been looking all over for more,
"husband loves this for golf as it‚Äôs so comfortable, lightweight",
but does not cling,
perfect fit,
washes well,
keeps its shape,
"the material is very soft and feels great,",
"however, i wish there was some degree of taper to the waist",
the shirt is very boxy,
"that's not an issue if that is how you prefer yours,",
"however, if you're looking for something that comes in a little as it goes down from the shoulders, this is not the fit you'll find in this shirt",
as a wife i thought the shirt was a perfect fit for my husband,
he stated that he wished it was a little longer he felt it was to short at the bottom and a little tighter than what he's used to,
i felt that he was just a little uncomfortable with having a bigger stomach,
i didn't have him raise his hands to see if it would lift and show anything,
but my experience i think it would have,
i would probably go up one size for this,
great comfortable shirt,
love the material,
similar to under armour polo,
calvin klein runs small,
i am six feet tall 180 lbs,
i am wearing a xl and it fits perfect,
i have broad shoulders,
secondly machine wash cold and hang dry,
don't put these in the dryer if you can avoid it,
"i love ck and specifically the liquid touch polos,",
but this one had little holes in the front bottom after just a few weeks - just after the return window closed,
very disappointing,
it is not moths as this is the only item in my closet this happened to and i don't do anything unsual,
while wearing it,
"very nice fit,feel and weight",
i ordered a small to have a fitter look,
normally i wear medium,
"love these polos, good fit and design",
fit is as expected,
so many polo shirts have bad collars and these look great,
"i'm glad they come in multiple colors, including some interesting contrasting collar looks",
i will be stocking up a bit,
these are great polos if you buy them in stores,
but i ordered 2 from amazon and they both came with terribly creased collars,
i have tried steaming and ironing and nothing works to fix the permanent crease in the collars,
"aside from that, they are decent polos, fit nice on the arms",
"but are not to tight around the body, which is how i like my polos",
but i would avoid buying these online,
really disappointed,
bought this last minute for my husband and i'm so glad i did,
i love the look and he loves the comfort,
fits great,
would like it a bit longer,
but it does go right past the belt line,
bad product,
i wish i never ordered this,
"it was not liquid touch material, rough, heavy and didn‚Äôt fit well",
i got a similar one from macy,
it was so much better,
don‚Äôt know why amazon doesn‚Äôt quality control men‚Äôs clothing,
just like the ones i bought at the store,
"i bought this for my father for father's day and because of quarantine i was unable to go shopping for him, i ordered him this shirt and it fit perfectly and he loved it",
this is literally the first negative review i've ever wrote on amazon,
"i am 5'11"", 160 lbs",
i purchased the large and it barely goes past my waistline,
and it's very wide,
"it would be a great fit for a short husky guy,",
but unwearable for me,
unfortunately i took the tags off so i can't return it,
i liked it so so much and also hubby,
it was gifted from my side,
for my hubby birthday üéÅ,
t-shirt is very very stunning,
shirt fit really small,
"i normally wear xlarge, 6 ft tall 210 lbs",
after washing it one time i cant even get shirt on shrunk so much,
great polo,
love the material,
ended up getting the wrong size for the husband so i returned,
but this is a great polo,
good material,
color is beautiful and the same as shown in the pictures,
it fits great,
"a good purchase, indeed",
"while this item is an amazing quality, delivered on time, fits well",
i had to give this 3 stars because it's not what i ordered,
i assumed i'd be getting a black polo with a grey strip at the chest,
but what i received was just a plain black polo,
"the color is ""black""",
but the image has a grey stripe on it,
my man looked so good in this shirt,
very breathable and comfortable,
would highly recommend,
"nice shirt, didn't shrink and it fits, though the collar is smaller than i expected",
"fits a size smaller, quality looks and feels good",
suggest if you are not in shape and have a tone stomach don‚Äôt buy this shirt,
very very comfortable,
wish it was for sleeping in,
very breathable too,
my most comfortable shirt,
christmas gift for my son,
he loves it,
"shirt is as expected, would order again",
one of the best polos i've ever had,
fits perfectly and it's very good quality,
highly recommended,
"the collar doesn't lay correctly,",
"but other than that, love the shirt",
suave al tacto,
excelente producto,
as soft as it gets,
not worth full msrp price,
"fits, looks and is truly great quality love the style as well",
exactly what i wanted in a polo shirt,
perfect for the hot weather here in vegas,
excellent quality with value for money,
i wanted a higher quality shirt to wear with chinos and this shirt met my needs with style and presentation,
i bought two shirts,
white and,
only disappointment is unavailability of several colors including green,
muy ligera,
very good quality and fit,
good,
very sexy shirt,
too small,
you need to go at least a size up,
maybe 2,
i have been wearing liquid touch polo shirts in past which were made in vietnam,
this one is made in sri lanka,
and this one does not fit as good as previous ones,
it is bit long and loose from chest,
does not appear as a slim fit,
feels great still even after washing a couple of times,
i especially like the sleeves as they pull in around my biceps giving them the appearance of looking bigger then they are,
5stars,
the seams on the inside shoulders of the shirt scratch against the shoukders,
not comfortable,
perfect fit,
comfortable,
"very comfy , i will be buying couple more to have a side",
i was looking for basic polo shirts for work,
also wanted good quality and 100% cotton,
these shirts are all that and more,
extremely comfortable and cool,
will be getting all the other available colors,
"this polo shirt fit better than i expected, and the fabric is incredibly soft",
looking forward to wearing this for many years to come,
the comfort and fit of the shirt was good,
the fabric does feel a little heavy for what i was expecting from calvin klein,
there's not a lot of breathability through the shirt,
"overall, a decent shirt",
no me gust√≥ para nada mi talla es m y lo mandaron m/m demasiado ancho,
i like the color and it airways to be be well made and an original ck,
color matches exactly the photo,
the fabric quality and shirt in general is excellent,
my husband lived the way it fitted him,
light weight,
comfortable and dress up or dress down,
good looking and comfortable to wear,
super comfortable and great quality i hope they never change,
fit was not slim fit,
"if clavin klein is known for fit and style, then this is mislabelled",
probably a good shirt for summer golf,
perfect,
fit very perfect,
"bety good material, is ck original",
shirt fit ok at first,
but after one wash went from a large to now sized for a large awkwardly shaped toddler,
would not buy this again,
extremely short shirt,
el estilo es muy mal no vale la pena pagar $50,
real calvin klein shirt and first time i‚Äôve bought one since i can afford the price,
that being said it‚Äôs a plain black polo shirt,
"very soft , well made",
"good looking shirt, fits very well",
its a good quality shirt,
but its not dry fit like,
"played golf once and after 2 rounds, was sweaty and back was completely wet",
will need to use for casual wear only,
"i'm 6'3"" and about 200 lbs",
not a big gut either,
the shirt is just a couple of inches too short,
"fine when standing still,",
"but uncomfortable when reaching, or bending",
no way there is enough to tuck in,
bought this shirt for my boyfriend he loved it and the color looked good on him too also the material is soft and comfortable,
"this may be my new ""go to"" polo",
the fit is great,
"it looks great, and is very comfortable",
espectacular se ci√±e al cuerpo y su color y dise√±o geniales,
compre la azul marino,
"very satisfied with my purchase, original calvin klein product",
ok,
great product very comfortable,
the shirt i received did not match the picture and none of the tags on it stated it had a 30-50 uv resistant rating,
the shirt i received was totally white,
the shirt i thought i was ordering based on the picture was supposed to be white with a light grey collar with three different colored stripes across the chest area,
"great quality, light and smooth",
comfy,
looks great,
very good k,
soft and durable fabric,
can wash at home does not wrinkle,
excellent quality,
i buy this style for my husband and he loves them,
they are comfortable and look great on him,
muy buena calidad,
good quality shirt,
very lightweight,
breaths well,
fits as expected,
cheap quality shirt,
"nice material, black is nice",
muy bueno,
fits and looks great,
regalo para mi esposo,
le gust√≥ mucho,
material is good,
"so far, so good - we will see how it wears",
awesome fit and i am a large person,
my husbands favorite shirts,
wish i could find more in his 3xl tall size,
son loved the shirt and fit,
the color is a deeper green,
do not buy this shirt if you want this color,
i bought xl size and after washing and drying the first time it became small size,
shrunk a lot,
i want to return the product,
i fell cheated,
the shirt was too small in the bottom stomach area,
i felt it was too expensive as well,
a most comfortable shirt in hot weather,
feels cool and soft,
bought a few of these for vacation,
"look good, feel good, nice and light",
no complaints here,
its to big to be large and its not the same the picture,
liked so much i bought 5,
very good and comfort shirt high quality fiber,
nice quality shirt order xl like all my other shirt,
fit fine across chest great,
but short in length when raise arm  up  to chest level,
great shirt,
love the fabric and quality,
se encogi√≥ a la primera lavada,
i am 5,
10 / 240 and medium looks absolutly perfect,
the shirt looks and feels fantastic,
shirt quality was good,
but little shorter than expected,
the fit wasn't the concern it was the length,
el material,
fit was not ‚Äúgenerous‚Äù,
"but tight across shoulders, and sleeves are too short",
great shirt,
"soft, well made, can‚Äôt go wrong with this shirt",
so happy bought 2 more,
soft and fits well,
bro in law loves the shirt,
"me quedo muy bien, es fresca y ligera y la tela estira un poco",
comfy looks good and not that expensive,
excellent,
"it has a nice feel when wearing it and wasn't too big or too small,was perfect",
i love it,
all good,
excelente producto,
great shirt,
"fake cc liquid , different labels from original",
"after 1 wash, the collar was no longer straight",
"i would give it 0 stars, if possible",
it shrank 2 sizes after the first wash,
was ok,
simple,
but nice,
this item is a counterfeit,
it is too poorly made to be an actual calvin klein shirt,
cool stuff,
i like,
material looks like silk,
drape,
soft,
fine,
luster,
"fits well, shirt is soft",
will buy more,
i‚Äôm trying to change it to get three xl,
"very nice material, good fit",
excellent product and service,
good,
"very nice, definitely cool touch",
everything is ok,
very good quality,
made in the us: all calvin klein sportswear products are made and shipped in the us????,
this is bs,
its says made in vietnam on the tag,
fix your false statement,
muy buena calidad,
"good product, just as i expected",
i have a hard time finding anything that's my size as far as my body typed being as small as it is so i mean i can appreciate the quality,
but it just didn't work for me,
this is a product by calvin klein that's honestly a sentence that says quite a bit quality satisfaction and a price that isn't nearly as comfortable as this fabric,
it actually shrunk after one wash,
bonita tela queda perfecta,
very good,
"la talla y la calidad del producto que la perfecci√≥n, solo que la m√≠a lleg√≥ con botones blancos y en la imagen son negros, y adem√°s la m√≠a s√≠ tiene el logo de ck y en la imagen no, son detalles sin importancia pero si gustan tomarlos en cuenta",
the seller sent me a plain white shirt,
the one in the picture is not real,
ligeramente mas peque√±a que otras piezas que he comprado de la misma marca y modelo,
liquid touch,
", la diferencia visible es la etiqueta, a√∫n siendo el mismo modelo tienen distintas etiquetas y son de diferentes pa√≠ses de origen, esta en particular es made in vietnam y las anteriores son made in siri lanka, no se si eso tenga algo que ver con la diferencia de ajuste",
"otra peque√±a diferencia tambi√©n es el material, son 100% algod√≥n pero se siente algo distinto",
"tengan cuidado, no es el producto que muestran en la foto, es de menor calidad, el color parece deslavado no e sun negro solido",
nisiquiera es la misma etiqueta tengo un par de ck y nada que ver con su calidad entre las que compre en una tienda departamental y esta,
"con el toque que lo caracteriza la marca calvin clein de utilizar materiales finos de primera calidad, hace lucir una prenda muy c√≥moda y maravillosa",
en cuanto a la talla,
"m, es mi caso",
"la considero dentro de lo normal, no queda grande ni tampoco estrecha",
"una camisa muy c√≥moda para temporadas de calor, no se arruga casi y tiene un corte moderno",
por el precio de la oferta es una buena compra y sin duda adquir√≠a otros productos similares por la calidad y confort adem√°s del corte,
"la playera tiene una excelente calidad, es del tipo de tela fresca y se ajusta muy bien al cuerpo, definitivamente volver√≠a a comprar este producto",
total defective &amp,
duplicate product,
no brand logo on chest as shown in the picture,
the brand tag is not available anywhere in the t-shirt,
neither the tag in neck side nor the washing/fabrication tag at interior side,
even the t-shirt is torn from the neck part where the brand tag used to stitched,
i have ordered for replacement and this time i expect the original one,
"el producto me quedo muy bien, use de referencia otras camisas de esta marca que tengo y son bastante precisas  pero el color es mucho m√°s claro a como se ve en la imagen de un azul marino parece un cobalto o quiza m√°s claro",
"excelente calidad de los materiales, la talla es un poco m√°s grande, suelo ser talla mediana, pero ped√≠ chica y me qued√≥ perfecta, ni ajustada ni holgada",
"la talla es perfecta, quiz√° un poco grande pero en mi caso qued√≥ perfecto como me gusta",
es muy suave y la tela se siente muy bien,
"la tela de este tipo de camisas, algod√≥n l√≠quido, es lo mejor para el tacto, s√∫per suave",
le qued√≥ muy bien a mi esposo,
buen material de algod√≥n,
pero no me amoldo bien,
la tela es muy suave y el dise√±o y color lo hacen un b√°sico del guardarropa que nunca falla para hacerte ver c√≥modo y casual,
"muy excelente calidad, gran compra",
"es c√≥moda, fresca y se ve muy bien puesta",
sensacional al tacto y su estructura,
dato a tomar en cuenta: las tallas de ck en eeuu son m√°s amplias que en mexico,
"excelente la calidad del producto es muy buena, la talla es la adecuada no viene reducida como otras marcas",
la ame  muy buena tela s√∫per suave me veo incre√≠ble,
comprare otra definitivamente la s√∫per recomiendo,
"me queda perfecto talla mediana la tela muy agradable al tacto, me agrada mucho la marca ck",
"great colour, very comfortable",
wears and washes well,
i buy one size up so that it‚Äôs long enough,
mido 1,
76 y peso 72 kgs,
me qued√≥ muy bien aunque es un poquito larga,
"me gust√≥ mucho el dise√±o, pero estaba un poco grande para ser talla chica, a mi parecer",
otras playeras ck aqu√≠ en mexico de talla chica me quedan mejor,
la tela es incomparable,
nunca ninguna otra marca habia logrado esto,
no en mi experiencia,
"ajuste normal, y calidad que se espera de ck",
"el corte, el color la textura, todo perfecto",
queda bien,
fresca para una tarde de verano,
"el producto me quedo excelente con un buen precio, pero el color de la ropa no es  cin√©tico ni se parece de la foto subi√≥ ellos",
tiene color mas claro que imagin√©,
se ve mejor en persona que en fotos,
muy hermosa playera y la tela muy c√≥moda y suave,
la camisa me gust√≥ aunque en el anuncio tra√≠a una franja verde cosa que no llego as√≠ pero me gusto y me la qued√©,
bien,
tr√®s bon produit,
"muy buena calidad, la talla me quedo perfecta es justo lo que pides",
"calidad y precio, recomendado",
es de muy buena calidad y muy c√≥moda,
buena calidad de producto,
"excelente calidad de materiales, buen ajuste al cuerpo",
lleg√≥ mucho antes de lo esperado,
"i always wear l shirts,",
but this one is bigger than my size,
but the colour is good,
me qued√≥ muy bien con una tela de calidad muy suave,
very good thanks,
compr√© talla m,
"es m√°s bonita cuando la ves f√≠sicamente que en las fotos, el color es incre√≠ble",
"es corte ""regular"", s√∫per fresca",
"esta polo de liquid touch no tiene nada que ver , es la tela norma como cualquiera, nada que ver con las liquid touch",
excelente,
"muy c√≥moda, suave y fresca no es tan delgada",
"es c√≥moda, buenos materiales, no queda ajustada a como luce en el modelo pero est√° genial",
el color es mucho m√°s claro que en la imagen y la talla s es muy amplia,
es de buena calidad,
"excele calidad, en cuanto a originalidad todo en orden, viene un poco amplia pero es una excelente compra",
"excelente calidad, muy bonita, la tela es muy suave, el tama√±o viene  confirme a la talla, excelente compra",
la talla esta bien un poco mas larga de lo normal y el color no es un rojo es como color salmon no me gusto,
el producto queda muy bien,
excelente producto,
muy buen producto como siempre,
"pedi talla chica pero viene muy amplia, la tuve que vender a un amigo talla m",
"excelente producto, lo recomiendo ampliamente",
talla adecuada y material padr√≠simo,
"mi esposo encantado con su regalo, la textura de la playera es excelente",
no se parece al color de la foto que est√°n vendiendo,
muy suave algo grueso pero muy buen producto,
me gusto mucho la playera muy c√≥moda y la talla es perfecta,
calidad,
"la tela me gusto mucho, pero se equivocar√≥n en la talla",
calidad de tela buena todo como lo esperaba,
me env√≠aron una playera de otro color,
no me mandaron el estilo qu√© ped√≠,
me encanto s√∫per buena calidad y llego en 3 d√≠as,
no es el color anunciado,
"justo lo que esperaba, s√∫per c√≥modo",
muy buena calidad y buen producto,
muy bien,
perfecto,
excellent nice and light feels great,
